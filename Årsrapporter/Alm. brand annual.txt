ratios
*) return on equity in the parent company is calculated before tax in subsidiaries. the calculation of return on equity before tax for 2018 takes into account deferred tax of dkk 49 million from an intangible asset (customer relationships).
the key ratios for 2020 and 2019 have been calculated net of special costs totalling dkk 98 million and dkk 115 million before tax, respectively. in the financial highlights and key ratios, dkk 51 million of the dkk 115 million for 2019 is 
recognised under discontinued activities, while dkk 64 million can be attributed to the continuing activities as follows: non-life insurance dkk 44 million, life insurance dkk 5 million and other activities dkk 15 million. the loss on 
discontinued activities is included in the results before and after tax for both years. 
**) the calculation of financial ratios for 2020 and 2019 is based on the profit before tax on continuing activities and consequently does not include the loss on discontinued activities. 
in the key figures and financial ratios, no eliminations have been recognised between the profit on continuing activities and the loss on discontinued activities. eliminations totalled dkk 30 million before tax in 2020 and dkk 34 million in 2019.

overview of results
alm. brand group
overview of 2020 results
full-year consolidated financial results
alm. brand generated a consolidated pre-tax profit on 
continuing activities of dkk 833 million in 2020, against 
a pre-tax profit of dkk 553 million in 2019. the profit for 
2020 included special corporate expenses for restruc-
turing and divestment of the bank of dkk 98 million. the 
profit for 2019 included special costs of dkk 64 million 
related primarily to restructurings. the 2020 performance 
was highly satisfactory.
the realised profit on continuing activities equalled a re-
turn on equity of 17.1% before tax.
the past year saw major changes triggered by external 
events as well as changes implemented in the group, in-
cluding not least the sale of alm. brand bank a/s. over-
all, the group achieved a strong business performance 
supported by adaptability and execution excellence, 
while also recording a direct, positive knock-on effect of 
covid-19 in its 2020 financial performance. based on a 
generally lower level of activity due to the partial lock-
down of society, alm. brand recorded a positive effect 
on its results of about dkk 120 million driven by fewer 
reported claims. however, covid-19 also put premium 
income under pressure, as sales to both commercial and 
private customers were affected by restrictions prevent-
ing insurance agents from holding face-to-face customer 
meetings.
the group posted a loss on discontinued activities of dkk 
27 million after tax. alm. brand a/s incurred a loss of dkk 
106 million on the sale of the bank as a result of divest-
ment at 95% of the net asset value and transaction costs 
related to the sale. the loss on discontinued activities is 
inclusive of the bank’s profit of dkk 79 million after tax. 
against this background, the board of directors recom-
mends that a dividend of dkk 4.00 per share be distrib-
uted for 2020. the board of directors furthermore recom-
mends that also the postponed dividend in respect of the 
2019 financial year of dkk 3.00 per share be paid, resulting 
in a total dividend payout of dkk 7.00 per share following 
the annual general meeting scheduled to be held in april 
2021. after the dividend payout, alm. brand will still be 
strongly capitalised with a total capital ratio of 317%. the 
capitalisation level is considered sufficient to resist very 
severe stresses.
non-life insurance
non-life insurance generated a pre-tax profit of dkk 
880 million in 2020, against a pre-tax profit of dkk 607 
million excluding special costs of dkk 44 million in 2019. 
the performance was highly satisfactory and better than 
expected.
non-life insurance reported a technical result of dkk 815 
million in 2020, against dkk 570 million in 2019, reflecting 
a sustained positive trend in the underlying business and 
a better-than-expected claims experience on weather-re-
lated and major claims and a positive run-off result. 
gross premium income was up 2.0% to a total of dkk 
5,471 million, against dkk 5,365 million in 2019, and the 
combined ratio including run-off gains was 85.1, against 
89.4 in 2019. 
for parts of the year, non-life insurance activities were 
affected by covid-19 and the ensuing periods of partial 
lockdown of society. towards the end of q1 2020 and 
going into q2 2020, society saw a lower-than-usual level 
of activity with fewer claims being reported as a conse-
quence. over the summer months, the claims experience 
gradually returned to normal, but increased covid-19 
infection rates and the renewed lockdown of society in 
late autumn and in the winter months again drove activ-
ity lower, leading to fewer reported claims. this claims 
pattern was mainly characteristic of contents, motor and 
travel insurance lines.
financial markets overall developed favourably in 2020, 
with non-life insurance reporting an investment return of 
dkk 65 million. 
life insurance
life insurance generated a pre-tax profit of dkk 112 
million in 2020, against a pre-tax profit of dkk 96 million 
excluding special costs of dkk 5 million in 2019. 
total pension contributions amounted to dkk 1,504 mil-
lion, against dkk 1,850 million in 2019, covering growth in 
regular premium payments of 2.0% to dkk 819 million and 
a reduction in single payments to dkk 685 million from 
dkk 1,047 million in 2019. the performance was satisfac-
tory and in line with expectations, although growth was 
weaker than expected. 
the bonus rate was 15.2% at 31 december 2020, which 
was a decline of 0.9 of a percentage point relative to the 
year-earlier date. the bonus rate remained satisfactory in 
light of the very low interest rate environment. for 2021, 
the rate on policyholders’ savings has been fixed at 3% for 
new customers.

overview of results
other activities
other activities, consisting primarily of corporate ex-
penses, performed in line with expectations, reporting a 
pre-tax loss of dkk 61 million excluding special costs of 
dkk 98 million. in 2019, other activities reported a pre-tax 
loss of dkk 86 million excluding special costs of dkk 15 
million, but including expensed severance payments in 
connection with the departure of the former ceo.
 
discontinued activities
banking
the bank generated a pre-tax profit of dkk 97 million in 
the period until the sale on 30 november 2020, against a 
pre-tax profit of dkk 67 million excluding special costs of 
dkk 51 million in 2019. the performance was satisfactory 
and in line with expectations. profit after tax was dkk 79 
million.
the bank’s core earnings amounted to dkk 136 million in 
2020 (11 months), against dkk 84 million in 2019, support-
ed by higher net interest and fee income and lower costs 
as a result of the income and cost initiatives implemented 
earlier in the year. 
as a result of the divestment at 95% of the net asset value 
and transaction costs related to the sale, a loss of dkk 
106 million was recognised in connection with the sale of 
the bank, resulting in a loss on discontinued activities of 
dkk 27 million.
major events
sale of alm. brand bank a/s and formation of strate-
gic partnership with sydbank a/s
alm. brand has sold alm. brand bank a/s to sydbank a/s 
and formed a strategic partnership with sydbank a/s as 
described in company announcement no. 40/2020 of 1 oc-
tober 2020. the sale of the bank was completed at 95% of 
the net asset value and freed up capital in a net amount 
of approximately dkk 1.2 billion. 
the agreement to form a strategic partnership with syd-
bank among other things entails that sydbank will distrib-
ute alm. brand’s insurance products to its customers, that 
alm. brand will distribute sydbank’s banking products and 
that both companies will jointly invest in developing new 
and innovative products and creating a unique custom-
er experience. the partnership is expected to strengthen 
alm. brand’s market position.
share buybacks
since 2015, alm. brand a/s has used share buyback pro-
grammes as part of the total distribution. the principal 
shareholder, alm. brand af 1792 fmba, participates propor-
tionately in the buyback programmes, thereby maintaining 
its ownership interest at about 58%. 
at 12 march 2020, alm. brand a/s completed the share 
buyback programme of dkk 200 million initiated in 2019. 
the group initiated no new share buyback programme in 
2020.
share-based remuneration scheme
in december 2020, like the year before, the group’s em-
ployees were offered to participate in a share-based re-
muneration scheme. the scheme runs for a period of one 
year with effect from 1 january 2021, and the shares will 
be granted on a quarterly basis, the first grant taking place 
in may 2021. the scheme represents a total market value 
of dkk 28 million. shares to be granted under the share-
based remuneration scheme are purchased in the open 
market, and the scheme has been individually approved by 
the danish financial supervisory authority.
significant events after the balance sheet 
date
extraordinary distribution 
alm. brand a/s distributed dkk 1.2 billion in january 2021, 
corresponding to an extraordinary dividend of dkk 8.00 
per share. the distribution was effected as a consequence 
of the sale of the bank and the capital freed up in that 
connection.

introduction
to our shareholders
the annual report for 2020 tells the story of a highly sat-
isfactory year for alm. brand. the group achieved profit 
growth in a year that saw the implementation of a number 
of strategic measures which will come to shape our busi-
ness in the years ahead in a transformational way. al-
ready at the beginning of the year, the first changes were 
announced with the formation of a new and more cus-
tomer-driven organisation across the individual business 
areas. later in the year, we announced a partnership with 
volkswagen semler finans danmark, and in late autumn 
alm. brand bank a/s was sold and alm. brand entered into 
a strategic partnership with sydbank. the many initiatives 
characterised a year of transformation and execution of a 
strategy through which we strive for well-defined priori-
ties and a more distinct profile for alm. brand. 
however, the year will be remembered for something 
completely different than our internal changes, opt-ins 
and opt-outs. 2020 will be remembered for the covid-19 
pandemic, which changed the entire world. in these con-
ditions, alm. brand proved capable of quickly transitioning 
to a different reality with virtual customer meetings, wide-
spread use of distance working and in some areas a fur-
ther acceleration of the use of digital solutions. in spite of 
the many challenges, the group’s employees have shown 
exceptional commitment and delivered an outstanding 
performance towards both customers and colleagues.
highly satisfactory development
alm. brand achieved a performance which, overall, is 
considered to be highly satisfactory, among other things 
reflecting enhancement of operations as a result of the 
earnings and cost initiatives implemented at the beginning 
of the year.
the group generated a consolidated pre-tax profit on 
continuing activities of dkk 833 million in 2020, against 
a pre-tax profit of dkk 553 million in 2019. the profit for 
2020 included special corporate expenses for restruc-
turing and divestment of the bank of dkk 98 million. the 
profit for 2019 included special costs of dkk 64 million 
related primarily to restructurings. in other words, the 
group reported highly satisfactory year-on-year growth in 
consolidated earnings.
alm. brand bank a/s was sold on 1 october 2020 and 
transferred to sydbank at the end of november 2020, the 
transaction freeing up capital in the group in a net amount 
of dkk 1.2 billion. this capital was distributed to the 
shareholders in january 2021 by way of an extraordinary 
dividend payout of dkk 8.00 per share. 
based on the profit for the year, the board of directors 
recommends that a dividend of dkk 4.00 per share be dis-
tributed for the 2020 financial year. the board of directors 
furthermore recommends that the postponed dividend in 
respect of the 2019 financial year of dkk 3.00 per share be 
paid, resulting in a total dividend payout of dkk 7.00 per 
share.
change to preserve
our best estimate for the years ahead, though, is that 
changes will continue, perhaps even at an accelerated 
pace. alm. brand needs to continue to change in order to 
retain the group’s position as an attractive player in the 
danish non-life and life insurance market. accordingly, we 
will be looking into a future of continued digitalisation and 
automation of workflows and processes – while keeping 
an eye on the changes and consolidation taking place in 
the external environment close to us. for alm. brand, this 
means that it is important to secure a greater volume of 
business, among other things based on the partnerships 
we have forged.

outlook for 2021
outlook for 2021 and targets for 2022
expectations are for an overall pre-tax profit of dkk 600-650 million in 2021.
financial outlook for 2021
alm. brand expects to report a pre-tax profit of dkk 600-
650 million excluding run-off gains and losses in 2021.
non-life insurance is expected to post a pre-tax profit 
of dkk 575 million. this guidance is based on premiums 
growth of more than 3% and a related increase in acqui-
sition costs as a result of investments and commissions 
derived from the partnership agreements with sydbank 
a/s and vw semler finans danmark a/s. to this should 
be added payment of corporate expenses related to the 
former banking operations of dkk 50-75 million. in the 
period until the end of 2022, these corporate expenses  
are expected to be aligned to reflect the tasks to be per-
formed in the group going forward. in 2021, some of these 
corporate expenses will be offset by a payment from syd-
bank. the expense ratio for 2021 is therefore expected to 
be at the level of 17-17.5.
the guidance also reflects that the continued lockdown of 
danish society is expected to impact the claims experi-
ence favourably and that the claims experience for weath-
er-related and major claims is expected to normalise. the 
combined ratio excluding run-offs is expected to be about 
90.
life insurance is expected to generate a pre-tax profit of 
dkk 100 million and growth in regular premium payments 
of 3-4%.
other activities are expected to report a pre-tax loss of 
dkk 50 million, including a small positive contribution 
from the remaining mortgage deed and debt collection 
portfolio and a small portfolio of unlisted shares.
the financial outlook is based on the assumption of con-
tinued low interest rates in 2021. the group has a sub-
stantial portfolio of investment assets, and a continued 
low interest rate level therefore affects all of the group’s 
business areas. 
financial targets for the period until 2022
alm. brand has defined a number of financial targets for 
the period until 2022. for non-life insurance, the previ-
ously announced targets are maintained, but for life in-
surance the growth target is adjusted to 4-5% (previously 
7%) to reflect the discontinuation of distribution through 
alm. brand bank. 
in addition to the financial targets, alm. brand has defined 
non-financial targets in respect of customer and employee 
satisfaction. the target for customer satisfaction of 70 as 
expressed by the net promotor score and the target for 
employee satisfaction of a score of 80 are maintained.
after the sale of the bank and the formation of several 
partnerships, alm. brand will revisit the overall strategy for 
the group. in 2021, a process to define the group’s strategy 
and shape the course for the future after 2022 will there-
fore be initiated.

strategy
alm. brand for the customer 
alm. brand for the customer defines the group’s strategy for 
the period until 2022
some years ago, alm. brand launched the group’s business 
strategy under the heading alm. brand for the customer. 
this has been – and still is – an ambitious strategy by 
which we want to highlight the characteristic and unique 
features of alm. brand and by which we want to stand out 
from the competition in the danish non-life and life insur-
ance market. the core of the strategy is a strong customer 
focus and providing a customer experience across the 
full spectrum of our product range. we want to estab-
lish close ties with our customers, and we aim to build a 
customer satisfaction that underpins loyalty and supports 
long-term customer relationships.
within the framework of this strategy, we developed 
and focused our business in 2020; developed meaning 
to ensure innovative and future-proof customer service 
solutions and focused meaning to make strategic opt-ins 
and opt-outs supporting the way we believe we can best 
develop our business.
with these initiatives, we have taken important strategic 
steps to ensure the transition required to align alm. brand 
to the structural changes taking place in the financial 
sector.
 
strategy foundation
digital business development at alm. brand 
the many opportunities offered by digitalisation are being 
embraced throughout the financial sector. for alm. brand, 
these opportunities are about creating even more custom-
er-oriented and intuitive solutions accessible as and when 
it suits the customer and about using technology to save 
unnecessary costs and invest in new digital value propo-
sitions for the customer instead. our vision is to meet the 
personal needs of each individual customer using digital 
solutions, building solutions that facilitate integration of 
our technology with external business partners.
focusing of activities and resources
at the end of november 2020, we closed the book on 32 
years of carrying on banking operations in the alm. brand 
group. alm. brand bank a/s was sold and transferred to 
sydbank. as a result of the divestment, the group’s busi-
ness focus going forward will be non-life and life insur-
ance. 
our focus is now on bringing together all of the group’s 
operating and development competencies to strength-
en these two core businesses, including to promote our 
brand, customer satisfaction and value proposition.
strategic partnerships
alm. brand stepped up its partnership ambitions in 2020. 
the strategy going forward is for partnerships to support 
the group’s overall strategy of building a new position, new 
growth, a new customer experience and new solutions. 
the partnership efforts are intended to contribute to 
securing further access to customer segments and sales 
with a primary focus on building new growth. 
partnerships will be developed in a way that ensures that 
alm. brand stands out from the competition – and lever-
ages its strong brand, wide product range and advantages 
in the digital field, among other things by forming a deeper 
technological integration with its partners that is unprece-
dented in the market.
our 2020 efforts included forging partnerships with g4s, 
volkswagen semler finans danmark and sydbank.
priorities towards 2022
backed by the many changes in 2020, alm. brand is facing 
a year in which most of our focus will be on executing on 
the new initiatives. it is essential that our digital business 
development efforts produce solutions generating satis-
fied customers and realising the expected rationalisation 
benefits. and it is important that our partnership invest-
ments contribute to accelerating growth at alm. brand. 
at the beginning of 2020, alm. brand defined clear goals 
and targets for the group for the period until 2022 in order 
to make it clear to us and the world around us what we 
aim to achieve. following the formation of partnerships 
and the divestment of alm. brand bank, the financial 
targets have been updated to express our commitment to 
striving for value creation for our customers, employees 
and shareholders, including our majority shareholder, alm. 
brand af 1792 fmba.

full-year financial results
non-life insurance generated a pre-tax profit of dkk 880 
million in 2020, against a pre-tax profit of dkk 607 million 
excluding special costs in 2019. the full-year performance 
was satisfactory and better than expected. the 2020 
performance was lifted by an improved claims experience 
driven by a lower level of activity in society during the 
covid-19 lockdown as well as by completed profitabili-
ty-enhancing measures. the pre-tax profit for 2019 was 
dkk 563 million including special costs.
the technical result amounted to dkk 815 million in 2020, 
against dkk 570 million in 2019. 
the combined ratio was 85.1 in 2020, being favourably 
affected by fewer expenses for both weather-related and 
major claims as well as by a lower claims frequency level 
during the temporary lockdown of society. net of run-off 
gains on claims provisions, the combined ratio was 87.2.
the underlying combined ratio was 79.1 in 2020, mark-
ing a 3.5 percentage point improvement relative to 2019, 
including an estimated positive effect of covid-19 of 2.2 
percentage points. 
premiums
gross premiums rose by 2.0% to dkk 5,471 million in 2020, 
an improvement from the 2019 growth rate of 1.7%. how ever, 
growth in 2020 was below the expected level, partly due 
to a lower level of activity in society and partly to a gener-
ally more competitive market, which resulted in increased 
customer outflow. in addition, alm. brand wants to retain its 
focus on profitability and has therefore implemented a num-
ber of profitability measures over the past couple of years. 
the lockdown of society also had a negative effect on pre-
mium income, among other things because premiums on 
workers’ compensation insurance policies were adjusted 
in connection with redundancies and also because the 
low level of activity naturally had a negative effect on both 
sales and total premium income.
for the commercial customer segment, customer loyalty re-
mained at a stable level. for the private customer segment, 
customer loyalty traced downward, mainly due to profita-
bility-enhancing measures. however, the retention rates for 
private and commercial customers remained at a high level.
claims experience
the claims experience was 68.2%, against 72.0% in 2019. 
the positive trend in the claims experience should be 
seen against the backdrop of a general decline in activity 
during the lockdown of society, with covid-19 affecting 
the claims experience favourably by 2.2 percentage points. 
the claims experience was also lifted by a lower level of 
expenses for weather-related claims and major claims 
as well as by the favourable effects of procurement and 
claims processing initiatives. finally, the run-off result 
affected the claims experience favourably by 2.1 percent-
age points. net of the run-off result, the claims experience 
was 70.3%.

weather-related claims
no major weather-related events were reported in 2020. 
expenses for weather-related claims net of reinsurance 
were dkk 80 million in 2020, against dkk 140 million in 
2019, which was also a mild year in terms of weather-re-
lated claims. weather-related claims affected the com-
bined ratio by 1.5 percentage points in 2020. 
major claims
both the number of major claims and total expenses for 
major claims came out slightly better than anticipated 
in 2020. one major fire claim was reported at a gross 
expense of dkk 68 million and a net expense of dkk 30 
million after reinsurance. net of reinsurance, major claims 
expenses totalled dkk 338 million, against dkk 308 mil-
lion in 2019, with an aggregate effect on the combined 
ratio of 6.2 percentage points. 
underlying business
the underlying claims ratio was 62.2 in 2020, which was 
markedly better than the claims ratio of 65.2 reported for 
2019 and significantly lower than expected at the begin-
ning of the year. the claims ratio was favourably affect-
ed by the temporary lockdown of society, which had a 
favourable knock-on effect on most insurance products. 
a lower level of activity and more people working from 
home meant fewer motor claims and a lower burglary 
frequency, while travel restrictions had a favourable effect 
on expenses for travel insurance claims. 
run-off result
run-off gains on claims net of reinsurance amounted to 
dkk 113 million, against dkk 77 million in 2019, including 
an additional provision for workers’ compensation lia-
bilities made during the year to counter changes in the 
processing of industrial injury cases by labour market 
insurance (arbejdsmarkedets erhvervssikring).
risk margin
the change in the overall risk margin reduced the full-year 
performance by dkk 20 million, equivalent to an increase 
in the combined ratio of 0.4 of a percentage point. by 
comparison, the risk margin lifted the 2019 performance 
by dkk 6 million, resulting in a drop in the combined ratio 
of 0.1 of a percentage point.
costs 
total costs amounted to dkk 926 million in 2020, against 
dkk 933 million in 2019, equivalent to an expense ra-
tio of 16.9. the reduction was driven in particular by the 
cost-saving measures taken at the beginning of 2020, 
which, however, were partly offset by general wage devel-
opments, investments in automation and the new partner-
ships as well as by compensation provided to insurance 
agents in the first months of the covid-19 lockdown when 
the sales situation was under pressure.
including special costs, total costs amounted to dkk 956 
million in 2019.
net reinsurance ratio
the net reinsurance ratio for the year was 3.6%. in 2020, 
alm. brand had one major claim of dkk 68 million that 
triggered coverage of dkk 38 million under the reinsur-
ance programme, driving the net reinsurance ratio lower 
than the 4.6% reported in 2019. 
 
discounting
the discount rates used fell marginally from 31 decem-
ber 2019 to 31 december 2020. interest rates increased in 
early spring following the major interest rate declines in 
2019, but dropped again after the covid-19 pandemic set 
in. at the end of 2020, interest rates were marginally lower 
than at the beginning of the year, and both short-term and 
long-term interest rates were in negative territory at 31 
december 2020. due to the composition of expected cash 
flows, the technical provisions are affected the most by 
movements in short-term interest rates. overall, the ef-
fect of interest rate developments on the financial results 
in 2020 was on a par with 2019.
private
the technical result amounted to a profit of dkk 507 mil-
lion in 2020, against dkk 346 million in 2019. 
the combined ratio was 81.6, which was satisfactory 
and significantly above expectations. the improvement 
was driven by lower expenses for both major claims and 
alm. brand annual report 2020
17 
non-life insurance
weather-related claims and a favourable claims experi-
ence on minor claims due to the lower level of activity in 
society caused by covid-19. the run-off result also con-
tributed favourably to the result.
premium income was up by 2.5% to dkk 2,761 million, 
which was below the level expected for the year. the 
profitability-enhancing measures in the private customer 
segment continued in 2020 with price adjustments for a 
number of private customers whose risk was not correct-
ly reflected in the price. as a result, customer retention 
fell slightly in 2020, although the retention rate remained 
at a high level. during some periods, sales fell short of 
the expected level, which to a certain extent was due to 
the lower level of activity in society caused by covid-19. 
in addition, competition was fierce for some specific 
insurance products, for instance motor insurance, which 
in 2020 also had a negative knock-on effect on other 
insurance products, as customers typically prefer to have 
all their insurance policies with one insurance company. in 
response to this, alm. brand at the end of the year made 
a number of price adjustments across the motor insur-
ance segments to ensure a continued competitive value 
proposition.
the claims experience excluding run-off gains on claims 
was 67.6%, marking an improvement from 71.4% in 2019.
net of reinsurance, expenses for weather-related claims 
amounted to dkk 30 million in 2020, against dkk 43 mil-
lion in 2019. in spite of heavy rainfall at the beginning of 
the year, four windstorms and a number of small cloud-
bursts in summer, weather conditions were generally fa-
vourable, causing the expense level to come out below the 
level expected at the beginning of the year. weather-re-
lated claims affected the combined ratio by 1.1 percentage 
points in 2020, against 1.6 percentage points in 2019. 
expenses for major claims totalled dkk 58 million net of 
reinsurance, which was also less than expected, affecting 
the combined ratio by 2.1 percentage points. expenses 
were on a par with 2019, when major claims expenses also 
affected the combined ratio by 2.1 percentage points.
the underlying claims ratio was dkk 64.3 in 2020, which 
was less than anticipated. the claims ratio generally fell in 
several lines, largely as a result of the temporary lockdown 
of society due to covid-19.
 contents, motor and travel insurance are the products 
that are the most affected by covid-19, with comprehen-
sive motor, travel and contents insurance seeing a drop 
in claims ratios. moreover, a number of claims-preventing 
measures were initiated in 2020, which also had a fa-
vourable effect on claims ratios in the private customer 
segment.
the run-off result on claims net of reinsurance was a gain 
of dkk 118 million, against dkk 91 million in 2019, mainly 
driven by a positive result on motor and personal accident 
insurance. 
the change in the overall risk margin reduced the full-year 
performance by dkk 4 million, equivalent to an effect on 
the combined ratio of 0.1 of a percentage point.

commercial
the technical result amounted to a profit of dkk 308 mil-
lion in 2020, against a profit of dkk 224 million in 2019. 
the combined ratio was 88.6, which was an improvement 
relative to expectations and 3.0 percentage points better 
than in 2019. the result was favourably affected by fewer 
minor claims due to the lower level of activity in society 
caused by covid-19, but also by a favourable claims expe-
rience on both weather-related and major claims.
premium income was up by 1.5% to dkk 2,710 million, 
which was below the level expected at the beginning of 
the year. competition from danish players in the commer-
cial customer market was generally fierce. moreover, pre-
miums on workers’ compensation insurance, among other 
things, were adjusted in connection with redundancies as 
a result of the lockdown of society, just as the lower level 
of activity in society had a direct effect on sales to new 
commercial customers in particular.
the customer retention rate remained at a stable, high 
level.
the claims experience excluding run-off gains on claims 
was 72.9%, against 75.4% in 2019.
net of reinsurance, expenses for weather-related claims 
amounted to dkk 50 million, which was dkk 46 million 
less than in 2019 and less than expected at the begin-
ning of the year. the expense level was lower because the 
summer cloudbursts and the windstorms in 2020 did not 
result in any major claims. weather-related claims affect-
ed the combined ratio by 1.9 percentage points in 2020, 
against 3.6 percentage points in 2019.
expenses for major claims were dkk 280 million net of re-
insurance, affecting the combined ratio by 10.3 percentage 
points, which was more than in 2019. in 2019, expenses for 
major claims were dkk 251 million net of reinsurance and 
affected the combined ratio by 9.4 percentage points.
the underlying claims ratio was 60.1 in 2020, which was 
an improvement from 62.1% in 2019. the lower level of 
activity in society due to the covid-19-related lockdown 
was the main reason why the claims frequency was lower 
than expected. 
in both 2019 and 2020, measures were taken that had a 
positive effect on the claims ratio, including measures to 
lift profitability on building insurances in the residential 
segment and on motor insurance and workers’ compen-
sation insurance. in 2020, the claims ratio was adversely 
affected by higher expenses for workers’ compensation 
claims due to changes in the processing of cases by la-
bour market insurance (arbejdsmarkedets erhvervssikring).
the run-off result on claims net of reinsurance amounted 
to a loss of dkk 5 million, against a loss of dkk 14 million 
in 2019.  during the year, additional provisions for workers’ 
compensation liabilities were made. 
the change in the overall risk margin reduced the results 
by dkk 17 million, equivalent to an effect of 0.6 of a per-
centage point on the combined ratio.
the net reinsurance ratio was 5.0 in 2020, against 7.0 in 
2019. the net expense for reinsurance in 2020 was affect-
ed in particular by a single major fire claim that triggered 
reinsurance coverage of about dkk 38 million.

investment result
the investment result after interest on technical pro-
visions was a gain of dkk 65 million in 2020, against a 
gain of dkk 37 million in 2019. the 2020 result was highly 
satisfactory in light of very low interest rate levels and the 
very volatile financial markets. moreover, the result was 
favourably affected by a strategic increase of the exposure 
to shares and credit bonds from and including q2 2020.
the company moved the management of its investments 
in regular bonds, credit bonds and shares to nykredit 
asset management in q4 2020. in connection with the 
change of asset manager, alm. brand chose to invest in a 
fund with sustainable high-yield credit bonds and in both 
passively and actively managed sustainable global equity 
funds.
the investment assets are distributed on danish and in-
ternational bonds, mortgage deeds and shares and a small 
portfolio of property investments. the goal is to achieve a 
satisfactory financial risk/return ratio. the financial risk is 
adjusted using derivative financial instruments.
the bond portfolio is placed in danish government bonds 
and mortgage bonds, european corporate bonds and de-

rivative fixed-income instruments. investments in govern-
ment and mortgage bonds are predominantly placed in 
issues carrying the highest rating, whereas investments 
in corporate bonds are mainly placed in the investment 
grade segment, i.e. investments carrying a rating of at 
least bbb-/baa3.
the low interest rate levels and the large remortgaging 
rounds detracted from the return, whereas the bond port-
folio investments were favourably affected by the interest 
rate declines in 2020.
the interest on technical provisions is calculated using 
the eiopa (european insurance and occupational pensions 
authority) yield curve including a volatility adjustment (va) 
premium. the asset portfolio for the hedging of interest 
rate risk on provisions is composed so as to match the 
fluctuations on provisions occurring in step with mar-
ket changes in the underlying components of the yield 
curve. the hedging strategy produced a satisfactory result 
throughout 2020, and the overall result of the hedging 
portfolio and value adjustment of provisions was positive.
the result of the mortgage deed portfolio fell short of 
expectations, as the low interest rate level drove up the 
volume of redemptions, thereby triggering capital losses. 
alm. brand forsikring has limited exposure to equities, 
consisting primarily of sustainable global equity funds and 
a small portfolio of strategic equities. the global equity 
markets developed favourably in 2020 and thus made a 
positive contribution to the performance.

life insurance
very satisfactory performance
full-year financial results
life insurance generated a total pre-tax profit of dkk 112 
million in 2020, against a pre-tax profit of dkk 96 million 
excluding special costs in 2019. the profit for the year was 
highly satisfactory, reflecting a positive expense result, an 
increase in the company’s profit from pension savings un-
der management and a positive return on assets allocated 
to equity. the pre-tax profit for 2019 was dkk 91 million 
including special costs. the profit for the year was in line 
with the most recent guidance.
the expense and risk result was dkk 53 million, which 
was unchanged relative to 2019 and still highly satisfac-
tory.
the year was marked by the covid-19 situation, mani-
fested in a sharp decline in the financial markets at the 
end of february 2020 due to concerns related to the very 
rapid spread of the epidemic across europe. from the end 
of march onwards, the financial markets recovered what 
they had lost and more, supported by relief packages and 
vaccination prospects. as a result, the bonus rate devel-
oped negatively in the first three months of the year, but 
subsequently recovered to stand at almost the same level 
at 31 december as at 1 january. 
the bonus rate was still among the best in the market at 
15.2%, enabling alm. brand pension to continue to offer 
one of the highest rates on policyholders’ savings in the 
market. offering a rate on policyholders’ savings of 3.0% 
in 2021, alm. brand pension is the market leader for the 
eighth year running. 
the company’s total assets under management grew by 
4.5% from dkk 16.2 billion to dkk 16.9 billion at 31 decem-
ber 2020. 
 
pension contributions
total premium income for the year was dkk 1,504 million, 
against dkk 1,850 million in 2019, due to modest growth in 
regular premiums of 2% and a decline in single payments. 
the reason for the decline in single payments was among 
other things a combination of restraint due to uncertainty 
triggered by covid-19 and a lower rate on policyholders’ 
savings in 2020 than in 2019. the latter resulted in more 
customers opting for alm. brand’s market rate product, 
which is now offered through sydbank. 
the commercial customer segment remained the compa-
ny’s primary growth driver for regular premium payments. 
growth in the commercial customer segment was driven 
by several strategic initiatives that have supported devel-
opments, including adjusted pricing of selected products 
in order to strengthen competitiveness. 
benefits paid
total benefits paid amounted to dkk 1,354 million, against 
dkk 1,034 million in 2019. the higher amount of benefits 
paid in 2020 was in line with expectations, in light of the 
lower rate on policyholders’ savings in 2020 and because 
some of the employees made redundant as a result of the 
changes made in the alm. brand group at the beginning 
of the year subsequently transferred their scheme and 
savings to their new employer. 
the risk result, which expresses the difference between 
risk premiums and claims expenses, was dkk 46 million, 
against dkk 44 million in 2019. the result was satisfacto-
ry and was due to gains on both mortality and disability 
risks. the risk result is still considered to rank among the 
best in the industry.
costs
acquisition costs and administrative expenses totalled 
dkk 107 million in 2020, against dkk 101 million exclud-
ing special costs in 2019. the higher amount was attrib-
utable to an increase in acquisition costs, among other 
things due to a change in the allocation of group expens-
es between the individual business areas. in 2019, costs 
amounted to dkk 106 million, including special costs 
related to the organisational adjustments made at the 
beginning of 2020.
net of reinsurance, the expense result, which expresses 
the difference between expense loading and expenses 
incurred, was positive at dkk 7 million in 2020, against 
dkk 9 million in 2019. the expense result for the year 
was highly satisfactory in light of the fact that alm. brand 
pension in 2020 lowered its direct costs to adapt to the 
current low interest rate environment and continued to 
have some of the industry’s lowest costs for average rate 
products. 
alm. brand annual report 2020

life insurance
reinsurance
reinsurance expenses came to a net amount of dkk 3 
million in 2020, which was unchanged from the 2019 level 
and marked a satisfactory performance considering the 
reduction in risk and, by extension, in fluctuations of the 
company’s results from reinsurance.
investment return on assets allocated to equity
the return on investment assets allocated to equity was a 
gain of dkk 1 million. this was better than expected, given 
the challenging investment environment with negative 
short-term interest rates, price volatility caused by cov-
id-19 fears and the fact that the return on assets allocat-
ed to equity included interest expenses for subordinated 
loans with a principal of dkk 150 million. 
investment return on policyholders’ funds
total investment assets belonging to policyholders 
amounted to dkk 17.5 billion at 31 december 2019. the 
investment assets were placed in bonds, equities and 
property. the return on investment assets belonging to 
policyholders was just under dkk 1.0 billion before pen-
sion return tax, corresponding to a return of 5.8%, against 
a return of 9.3% in 2019.
from an overall perspective, the return for the year was 
satisfactory. the investment return was impacted by sub-
stantial equity market fluctuations, sustained interest rate 
declines and major spread fluctuations on credit bonds 
and emerging market bonds. equities, properties and 
bonds produced positive returns. 
the property exposure was increased in 2020 through 
european property funds, ensuring a better risk balance in 
the portfolio.
life insurance provisions are calculated using a mar-
ket value principle that applies an expected cash flow 
discounted by the yield curve for discounting provisions 
published by eiopa. the 10-year point on the yield curve 
was at minus 0.02% at 31 december 2020, against 0.27% 
at 1 january 2020. the underlying risk-free rate of interest 
dropped in 2020, while the va premium only increased 
by 3 basis points, making for a fall in the aggregate eiopa 
yield curve. the interest rate decline had an adverse im-
pact on life insurance provisions, which was partly offset 
by positive returns on the investment assets, however.
life insurance provisions
total life insurance provisions grew by dkk 0.7 billion to 
dkk 16.6 billion in 2020, primarily as a result of the invest-
ment return achieved for 2020.
profit margin
the profit margin increased by dkk 26 million over the 
year, from dkk 357 million at 1 january 2020 to dkk 382 
million at 31 december 2020, driven by increased alloca-
tions to life insurance provisions. 
bonus rate
the total bonus rate was 15.2% at 31 december 2020, 
against 16.1% at 1 january 2020, marking a slight decline of 
0.9 of a percentage point. the dip was due to the interest 
rate declines in 2020, as a result of which the expected 
level of return will be lower going forward. the bonus rate 
remained satisfactory in light of the very low interest rate 
environment. 
new policyholders were placed in interest rate group a, 
which had a bonus rate of 15.7% at 31 december 2020.

in aggregate, 12% of the portfolio was placed in high in-

an investment strategy based on a substantial proportion 
of bonds and financial instruments with a view to striking 
a healthy balance between the groups’ investments and

major events
rate on policyholders’ savings for 2021
in december 2020, alm. brand pension announced that 
the company will continue to offer one the market’s high-
est rates on policyholders’ savings in the coming year. for 
2021, the rate on policyholders’ savings has been fixed at 
3% for new customers. 
new basis for writing business
the danish financial supervisory authority has announced 
that it is considering the size of the maximum technical 
rate of interest. already at the end of 2019, alm. brand 
pension lowered the technical rate of interest for new 
customers to 0%, but because of the continued low inter-
est rate level, the danish financial supervisory authority 
is considering whether the maximum technical rate of 
interest should be lowered even further. alm. brand is 
prepared for this situation, should it arise, and will contin-
ue to be able to offer customers the average rate product 
at an attractive rate on policyholders’ savings. 
the sale of alm. brand bank a/s
alm. brand bank a/s was sold with effect from 30 novem-
ber 2020. an agreement has been made with sydbank, 
ensuring that the market rate product is offered through 
sydbank going forward.

alm. brand’s core values are rooted in proper conduct in 
the way we do business and in the way we interact with 
the world around us.
for many years, proper conduct has been, and it still is, one 
of alm. brand’s core values – proper conduct in the way we 
think, the way we act and the way we communicate. a natu-
ral part of our dna is therefore that we feel a strong sense of 
corporate responsibility and want to leave a positive imprint 
on the world around us. as part of our corporate social re-
sponsibility efforts, we work to promote sustainable devel-
opment and make a favourable impact on society.
alm. brand seeks to conduct its business in a responsible 
and sustainable manner. alm. brand’s vision is: “we take 
care of our customers”. “taking care of” applies not only to 
customer relationships, but also to employee relationships, 
environmental and climate matters and to matters concern-
ing society in general.
through our csr policy, we seek to ensure alignment with our 
historical heritage and the pledge of proper conduct we have 
made to our customers and to develop our csr landscape on 
an ongoing basis to ensure that it is up to date and aligned 
with changes in society. alm. brand’s csr strategy is focused 
on the environment and climate, social and employee-related 
matters, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, human rights and 
socially responsible investment. these focus areas have been 
chosen because they support alm. brand’s business.
the full account of our corporate social responsibility efforts 
for 2020 is provided in alm. brand’s csr report, which is 
available together with the group’s csr policy here. 
alm. brand is a signatory to the un global compact, and the 
csr report therefore also represents alm. brand’s commu-
nication on progress (cop). 
the committee on corporate governance recommends 
that companies once a year discuss activities to ensure 
relevant diversity at all management levels in the group. 
the board of directors of alm. brand is focused on pro-
moting diversity, and back in 2013 alm. brand adopted 
a gender equality policy in accordance with applicable 
law. the policy is focused on increasing the share of the 
under-represented gender and encompasses an annual 
follow-up on the development in the share of men and 
women in management positions. 
the board of directors of alm. brand consists of 11 mem-
bers including employee-elected members. at 31 decem-
ber 2020, four of the 11 board members were women. as 
the board of directors has defined a target stipulating 
that the share of the under-represented gender must be 
at least 33%, the gender equality target was met. the full 
report on diversity in management as well as additional 
information and policies on the gender composition of 
management are available here.

capitalisation
capitalisation
after the sale of alm. brand bank, the alm. brand group 
calculates the aggregate capital requirement according to 
the solvency ii legislation.
alm. brand’s long-term business goals imply that the group 
assumes a variety of calculated risks on behalf of its cus-
tomers, which requires that alm. brand has adequate and 
satisfactory capital resources. the group’s risks are de-
scribed in detail in notes 42 and 43. 
the capitalisation level is considered sufficient to resist 
very severe stresses. the boards of directors of alm. brand’s 
subsidiaries are responsible for identifying and quantifying 
the most significant risks. the statutory capital requirement 
ensures that the companies are adequately capitalised to 
absorb very serious adverse events over the next 12 months 
without compromising outstanding customer accounts.
alm. brand has defined a target for ordinary dividend corre-
sponding to a payout ratio of at least 70% of the profit for 
the year after tax. however, such distribution will be subject 
to an assessment of any increased capital requirement over 
the following years, either due to planned activities, special 
risks or a shortfall in earnings.
total capital
the group’s total capital was dkk 3,846 million at 31 decem-
ber 2020, consisting of equity, tier 2 capital and the solvency 
ii capital elements profit margin and risk margin.  
the total capital includes tier 2 capital of dkk 400 million, a 
profit and risk margin of dkk 613 million and a dkk 24 mil-
lion deduction of deferred tax assets an intangible assets. 
moreover, the total capital is stated after deduction of a divi-
dend of dkk 8.00 per share paid on 8 january 2021 and after 
deduction of a proposed dividend of dkk 7.00 per share for 
2019 and 2020, respectively.
the solvency ii capital elements profit margin and risk margin 
increase the sensitivity of the total capital. alm. brand makes 
allowance for this sensitivity in the capital planning by in-
vestigating the effect on the total capital through a scenario 
analysis. in alm. brand forsikring, the profit margin stability is 
analysed and stress-tested by exposing it to a number of neg-
ative scenarios. in alm. brand pension, the analysis is based 
on how large a part of the profit margin may be contained in 
the bonus potentials in a stress scenario. 
statutory capital requirement
after the sale of alm. brand bank, the alm. brand group cal-
culates the solvency capital requirement according to the 
solvency ii legislation. due to its position as major share-
holder, alm. brand af 1792 is deemed to be the ultimate in-
surance holding company of the group. 
the sale of the bank also meant that both the capital re-
quirement and the required excess capital adequacy have 
declined, resulting in an extraordinary dividend payout of 
dkk 1.2 billion at the beginning of january 2021. the solven-
cy capital requirement of the alm. brand a/s group has been 
calculated at dkk 1,214 million, and the excess relative to 
the statutory capital requirement at year-end 2020 was thus 
dkk 2,632 million at 31 december 2020. 
the total capital of the alm. brand a/s parent company was 
dkk 3,085 million at 31 december 2020. with an aggregate 
solvency capital requirement of dkk 1,214 million, the excess 
cover was thus dkk 1,871 million.
non-life insurance and life insurance activities 
alm. brand forsikring a/s calculates its solvency capital re-
quirement on the basis of a partial internal model in combi-
nation with the standard formula of the solvency ii regime. a 
partial internal model is used to calculate the solvency capital 
requirement attributable to “premium and reserve risk” and 
“natural catastrophe risk”. the partial internal model is de-
signed to reflect the business structure and the reinsurance 
cover and is based on the company’s own data. 
the model is designed to most accurately reflect the risk 
exposure. the model currently covers all lines except work-
ers’ compensation and personal accident, but at the end of 
q3 2020, non-life insurance submitted an application to the 
danish financial supervisory authority for approval of an 
expansion of the company’s partial internal model to also 
cover these lines. 
the effect on the solvency capital requirement will vary de-
pending on the risk scenario and the composition of the port-
folio, but at present, and subject to approval by the danish 
financial supervisory authority, it will result in a lowering of 
the total requirement by about dkk 150 million. the effect 
will be recognised in the capital requirement at the earliest 
when a decision on the application is available.
the solvency capital requirement of alm. brand forsikring a/s 
was dkk 1,059 million at 31 december 2020.
alm. brand liv og pension a/s applies the standard formu-
la provided in the solvency ii legislation for the calculation 
of the company’s capital requirement. the solvency capital 
requirement of alm. brand liv og pension a/s was dkk 153 
million at 31 december 2020. the level of the solvency capital 
requirement is relatively high due to the high bonus poten-
tials in alm. brand liv og pension a/s, which had a bonus rate 
of 15.2 at 31 december 2020.
solvency ii legislation provides the option of including the 
loss-absorbing effect of a deferred tax asset in the calcula-
tion of the capital requirement. alm. brand has decided to 
make use of this option in the calculation of the capital re-
quirements of the two insurance companies.

statement on corporate governance
statement on corporate governance
alm. brand strives to obtain maximum transparency and 
openness and thus agrees with the basic principles of the 
corporate governance recommendations. this is reflected 
in the company’s management approach, which is generally 
consistent with the recommendations.
composition and organisation of the board 
of directors
close to 58% of the share capital of alm. brand a/s is held 
by alm. brand af 1792 fmba, which is an association with 
some 400,000 members, all of whom are customers of alm. 
brand forsikring a/s. as a result of this structure, five of 
the eight board members elected by the shareholders are 
nominated by alm. brand af 1792 fmba. the other board 
members elected by the shareholders are independent. 
the five board members nominated by the board of alm. 
brand af 1792 have been elected from among the mem-
bers of alm. brand af 1792 fmba’s committee of represent-
atives in pursuance of the association’s by-laws.
information about the recommended candidates’ back-
ground, qualifications and selection criteria are provided 
at the annual general meeting. information about e.g. the 
board members’ other executive positions and director-
ships as well as their special qualifications is provided in 
the financial statements. as regards new candidates, in-
formation on other executive positions and directorships, 
etc. is also provided in the complete proposals sent to 
shareholders ahead of the annual general meeting. 
as less than half of the board members elected by the 
shareholders are independent, alm. brand a/s deviates 
from the corporate governance recommendations. manage-
ment believes that the principal shareholder and the other 
shareholders have identical interests in the company.
board committees
the board of directors has set up two board committees 
– the audit committee and the remuneration committee. 
the chairman and the deputy chairman of the board of 
directors, who are not deemed to be independent, are 
members of these committees. the majority of the com-
mittee members are thus not independent. this is not in 
compliance with the corporate governance recommenda-
tions, but the board of directors has made this choice in 
order to ensure a strong focus on the work of the commit-
tees.
a detailed description of the tasks of the committees, the 
members of the committees, meeting frequency, etc. is 
available here.
the board of directors has not found it necessary to set 
up a nomination committee, as the majority of the mem-
bers of the board of directors are elected by the principal 
shareholder. 
when selecting and nominating the independent candi-
dates, alm. brand complies with the recommendation to 
take into consideration the need for integration of new 
talent and diversity in relation to age, international expe-
rience and gender, and the board of directors also obtains 
external assistance when selecting the independent can-
didates. 
governing bodies 
in compliance with danish legislation, alm. brand a/s and 
the group’s subsidiaries have a two-tier management sys-
tem with a board of directors and a management board. 
alm. brand af 1792 fmba is an association whose members 
are alm. brand forsikring’s customers. five of the eight 
shareholder-elected members of the board of directors 
are nominated by the principal shareholder. 
 
of the share capital is held by 
alm. brand af 1792 fmba.

statement on corporate governance
a detailed presentation of the members of the board of 
directors and the management board of alm. brand a/s 
is provided in the section listing directorships and special 
qualifications below. the responsibilities and duties of the 
board of directors and the management board are defined 
in the rules of procedure of the board of directors. 
the board of directors consists of eight members elected 
by the shareholders in general meeting and currently 
three members elected by the employees. of the 11 board 
members, seven are men and four are women. the age, 
seniority, other directorships and special qualifications of 
the board members are set forth in the list of director-
ships on pages 36-41. pia laub, karen sofie hansen-hoeck 
and anette eberhard are deemed to be independent, as 
they do not serve on the board of the company’s principal 
shareholder.
when nominating new members for the board of direc-
tors, the board of directors emphasises that as a whole 
the following qualifications are represented: general 
management experience, experience from the alm. brand 
group’s customer segments, experience in auditing and 
accounting matters, particularly in relation to membership 
of the audit committee, and insight into legal matters, 
insight into financial matters, experience in risk man-
agement and solvency matters, investments and general 
insight into it matters. 
board evaluation 
the board of directors assesses its overall qualifications 
and work procedures once a year. at least once every 
three years, the board of directors obtains external as-
sistance for the evaluation. as part of the evaluation, the 
number, level and complexity of other directorships held 
by the members of the board of directors are discussed 
with a view to ensuring that other directorships are kept 
at a reasonable level. the evaluation is presided over by 
the chairman of the board of directors. the evaluation 
procedure is based on the company’s business model 
and strategy and entails an evaluation of the individual 
qualifications of each member of the board of directors as 
well as of the combined qualifications of all members of 
the board of directors in accordance with the recommen-
dations of the danish financial supervisory authority on 
board evaluation. the evaluation also comprises e.g. the 
cooperation with the company’s management board, the 
chairman’s ability to lead the board of directors, commit-
tee work and the overall planning of board work. 
an external consultant assisted in the board evaluation in 
2020, which included an evaluation of the qualifications 
of new board members in combination with the qualifica-
tions of the other members of the board of directors, an 
update of the overview of the individual qualifications of 
all members of the board of directors as well as the board 
of directors’ cooperation with a newly appointed ceo. the 
evaluation did not give rise to any significant remarks. the 
results of the evaluation will form part of the work of the 
board of directors going forward.
the board of directors held 12 meetings in 2020. for 
information on the meeting attendance of each individual 
board member, see page 30.
additional information on the group’s management and 
organisational structures is available here.
remuneration policy
alm. brand’s remuneration policy is available on the 
group’s website. among other things, the remuneration 
policy contains information about the group’s share-based 
remuneration. further information about the remuneration 
of the board of directors and the management board is 
provided in note 6 to the financial statements as well as 
in the company’s remuneration report for 2020. click here 
for more information.
in 2019, the group complied with the remuneration policy 
described in the 2019 financial statements, and in 2020 it 
complied with the remuneration policy adopted for 2020. 
board of directors
board members receive a fixed annual remuneration re-
flecting the scope of the board work and the responsibility 
related to serving on the board.
in accordance with the remuneration policy, the board 
members are not remunerated by way of incentive 
schemes. 
pursuant to the corporate governance recommendations, 
the remuneration paid to the board members for the cur-
rent financial year must be approved by the shareholders 
in general meeting. the board of directors believes that it 
is sufficient that the shareholders approve the remunera-
tion paid to the board of directors in respect of the past 
financial year when approving the financial statements 
and that the chairman of the board of directors explains 
the expected remuneration payable to the board of direc-
tors for the current financial year.
management board
the members of the management board are remunerated 
by way of a salary which is intended to be competitive 
with similar positions in the financial sector. in addition 
to this salary, the company provides a pension contribu-
tion, and the remuneration also includes a company car, 
alm. brand annual report 2020

statement on corporate governance
paid telephone subscription and other customary salary 
substitutes. other directorships held by members of the 
management board in companies of the alm. brand group 
do not trigger any remuneration. the remuneration report 
is available here.
a share-based remuneration programme was established 
with effect from 1 july 2016. the award of shares by way 
of share-based remuneration takes place in the months of 
june and december, respectively. on 4 june 2020, 3,619

financial reporting process
the primary responsibility for alm. brand a/s’s risk 
management and control organisation in relation to the 
financial reporting process rests with the board of direc-
tors and the management board, including compliance 
with applicable legislation and other financial reporting 
regulations.
control environment
the board of directors has defined a working plan ensur-
ing that the board of directors reviews, at least once a 
alm. brand annual report 2020
31 
statement on corporate governance
year, the group’s:
• 
organisation
• 
plans and budgets 
• 
risk of fraud
• 
in-house rules and guidelines
the board of directors and the management board are re-
sponsible for establishing and approving general policies, 
procedures and controls in key areas in relation to the 
financial reporting process. the audit committee supports 
the board of directors in this work. on an ongoing basis, 
the management board monitors compliance with rele-
vant legislation and other financial reporting regulations 
and provisions, and reports its findings to the board of 
directors.
the group’s internal audit department reports directly to 
the board of directors in compliance with the audit plan 
presented by the internal audit department and adopted 
by the board of directors. the internal audit department 
performs sample audits of business procedures and inter-
nal controls in critical audit areas, including the financial 
statements and the financial reporting.
risk assessment
the working plan of the board of directors ensures that 
the board of directors and the management board at least 
once a year perform an overall assessment of risks in rela-
tion to the financial reporting process. in this connection, 
the board of directors assesses the group’s organisation 
with respect to:
• 
risk measurement and risk management 
• 
financial reporting and budget organisation
• 
internal control
• 
rules on powers of procuration 
• 
segregation of functions or compensatory measures 
• 
it organisation and it security
as part of the risk assessment, the board of directors 
considers the risk of fraud on an annual basis. this work 
includes:
• 
a discussion of management’s potential incentive/mo-
tive for committing fraudulent financial reporting or 
other types of fraud
• 
a discussion of management reporting with a view to 
preventing/identifying and responding to fraudulent 
financial reporting
the audit committee supports the board of directors in 
these assessments.
risk management and financial reporting process
day-to-day risk management is handled at segment level 
on the basis of risk limits defined by the management 
board and approved by the board of directors.
risk management is coordinated by a cross-organisational 
risk committee consisting of the management board and 
the companies’ risk managers as well as the persons in 
charge of the actuarial departments, the sales organisa-
tion, the it department, the finance department and the 
persons holding business responsibility in non-life insur-
ance and life insurance.
the finance department is responsible for preparing full-
year and interim financial statements. the key financial 
reporting contributors are the non-life and life insurance 
actuarial departments, which are responsible for calculat-
ing technical provisions, and the investment department, 
which is responsible for calculating the group’s financial 
assets and liabilities. 
the report is prepared by the investor relations de-
partment on the basis of information from a number of 
departments, including the finance department and the 
individual business areas. 
for a more detailed review of the risks facing the group, 
see note 42, capital and risk management, and note 43, 
significant accounting estimates, assumptions and uncer-
tainties. 
whistleblower scheme
in 2014, the group set up a whistleblower scheme as part 
of the implementation of new legislation. employees can 
alm. brand annual report 2020
32 
statement on corporate governance
use the whistleblower scheme to anonymously report 
violations or suspected violations of financial legisla-
tion committed by employees or board members of alm. 
brand’s companies. responsibility for the whistleblower 
scheme rests with the compliance department, which 
received no reports in 2020. 
active ownership
alm. brand invests in many different asset classes and 
therefore has a high degree of diversification. as a result, 
and considering the size of the group, the ownership in-
terest in the individual companies is quite/relatively small. 
the relatively small ownership interests are therefore not 
assessed to be sufficient to obtain any actual influence 
through active ownership. as a general rule, companies 
which are deemed to breach alm. brand’s policy on re-
sponsible investment will therefore be excluded from the 
investment universe. for the same reason, voting rights 
are generally not exercised, as such exercise is deemed 
to be too cost-intensive compared with the possibility of 
obtaining any actual influence. 
deviation from corporate governance rec-
ommendations
alm. brand is subject to the recommendations prepared 
by the committee on corporate governance, which are 
available at corporategovernance.dk. on an annual basis, 
the board of directors of alm. brand a/s considers all rec-
ommendations applying the “comply or explain” principle. 
the full account is available here. 
the group deviates from the corporate governance recom-
mendations in the following respects: 
• 
at least half of the board members elected by the 
shareholders are not independent. see “composition 
and organisation of the board of directors”
• 
the majority of the members of the board committees 
cannot be deemed to be independent. see “board 
committees”
• 
the board of directors has not set up a nomination 
committee. see “board committees”
• 
the selection and nomination of candidates for the 
board of directors is only partially carried out on the 
basis of the recommended criteria
• 
the qualifications of candidates for the board of di-
rectors are not described to the recommended extent 
ahead of the general meeting
• 
the remuneration of the board of directors is ap-
proved for the past year and not for the current 
financial year. see “remuneration policy–board of 
directors”
the board of directors believes that, overall, alm. brand 
a/s complies with the corporate governance criteria and 
that these few exceptions do not constitute a disadvan-
tage or are contrary to the interests of the shareholders or 
other stakeholders.

statement by the board of directors and the management board
the board of directors and the management 
board have today considered and approved 
the annual report of alm. brand a/s for the 
period 1 january to 31 december 2020.
the consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with the inter-
national financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the eu and danish disclosure 
requirements for listed financial enterprises. 
the parent company financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with the 
danish financial business act. the manage-
ment’s review has been prepared in accord-
ance with the danish financial business act.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent company finan-
cial statements give a true and fair view 
of the group’s and the parent company’s 
assets, liabilities and financial position at 
31 december 2020 and of the results of the 
group’s and the parent company’s opera-
tions and the consolidated cash flows for 
the financial year ended 31 december 2020.
in our opinion, the management’s review 
contains a fair review of developments 
in the group’s and the parent company’s 
activities and financial position and de-
scribes the principal risks and uncertainties 
that may affect the group and the parent 
company.
we recommend the annual report for adop-
tion at the annual general meeting.

auditor’s report
independent auditor’s report
to the shareholders of alm. brand a/s
opinion
we have audited the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent financial statements of alm. brand a/s for 
the financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020, which 
comprise the income state-ment, statement of compre-
hensive income, balance sheet, statement of changes in 
equity and notes, including the summary of significant ac-
counting policies, for the group as well as for the parent, 
and the consolidated cash flow statement and segment 
information. the consolidated financial statements are 
prepared in accordance with international financial re-
porting standards as adopted by the eu and additional 
danish disclosure requirements for listed financial compa-
nies, and the parent financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with the danish financial business act. 
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give 
a true and fair view of the group’s financial position at 
31 december 2020 and of its financial performance and 
cash flows for the financial year 1 january to 31 december 
2020 in accordance with international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu and additional danish 
disclosure requirements for listed financial companies.
also, in our opinion, the parent financial statements give 
a true and fair view of the parent’s financial position at 31 
december 2020 and of its financial performance for the fi-
nancial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 in accordance 
with the danish financial business act.
our opinion is consistent with our audit book comments 
issued to the audit committee and the board of directors.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international 
standards on auditing (isas) and the addi-tional require-
ments applicable in denmark. our responsibilities under 
those standards and requirements are further described 
in the “auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements and the parent finan-
cial statements” section of this auditor’s report. we are 
inde-pendent of the group in accordance with the inter-
national ethics standards board for accountants’ code of 
ethics for professional accountants (iesba code) and the 
additional requirements applicable in denmark, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accord-
ance with these require-ments. we believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
to the best of our knowledge and belief, we have not pro-
vided any prohibited non-audit services as referred to in 
article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 537/2014.
we were appointed auditors of alm. brand a/s before 
1995. we have been reappointed annually by decision of 
the general meeting for a total contiguous engagement 
period of more than 25 years up to and including the 
financial year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our profes-
sional judgement, were of most significance in our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements and the parent 
financial statements for the financial year 1 january to 
31 december 2020. these matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters.
outstanding claims, life insurance provisions and 
profit margin on life insurances
the calculation of outstanding claims, life insur-
ance provisions and profit margin on life insurances 
is complex and to a significant extent subject to 
accounting estimation that is based on manage-
ment judgements and assumptions about future 
events. auditing outstanding claims, life insurance 
provisions and profit margin on life insurances are 
therefore key audit matters.
outstanding claims, life insurance provisions and 
profit margin on life insurances amounted to dkk 
22,207 million at 31 december 2020 (dkk 21,144 
million at 31 december 2019), refer to note 23 to 
the consolidated financial statements.
management has specified the principles for 
determining provisions for insurance contracts in 
“summary of significant accounting policies”, note 
44 pages 110-119, and the related significant ac-
counting estimates and judgements, assumptions 
and uncertainties in note 43, pages 108-109, and 
specified the insurance provisions in note 23, pages 
75-80 to the consolidated financial statements.
we believe that the most significant risks relate to 
the following elements that are either particular-
ly complex and/or highly subject to management 
judgement:
• 
changes in methods, models and data ap-plied
• 
determination of expectations for future:
• 
claims incurred related to outstanding 
claims provisions
• 
cash flows, including determination of 
profit margin on life insurances.
alm. brand annual report 2020
46 
auditor’s report
• 
determination of expectations for mortality 
and disability
• 
management add-ons for actuarial calculations 
to mitigate the risk of adverse developments 
in claims for damages related to outstanding 
claims provisions.
how the matter was addressed in our audit
based on our risk assessment, we have audited 
management’s measurement of the statement of 
outstanding claims, life insurance provisions and 
profit margin on life insurances. 
our audit procedures included the following ele-
ments, where we also made use of our internation-
ally qualified actuaries:
• 
assessing and testing key controls related to 
claims handling processes and to recognition 
and measurement of outstanding claims, life 
insurance provisions and profit margin on life 
insurances
• 
challenging the assumptions, methods and 
models applied by using our industry knowl-
edge and experience, focusing on changes 
since last year
• 
random testing of the changes to the ”val-
uation” provisions program related to life 
insurance provisions and profit margin on life 
insurances
• 
testing the accuracy and completeness of 
data used to calculate outstanding claims, life 
insurance provisions and profit margin on life 
insurances
• 
assessing the basis and process for defining 
assumptions underlying the calculation of the 
profit margin on life insurance provisions
• 
recalculating outstanding claims provisions for 
selected non-life insurance industries by using 
portfolio data, including assessing manage-
ment add-ons.
based on our procedures, we did not identify any 
material exceptions and consider management’s 
assumptions and methods and models applied to 
calculate outstanding claims, life insurance pro-
visions and profit margin on life insurances to be 
within a reasonable range of accounting estimates.
statement on the management commentary
management is responsible for the management commen-
tary.
our opinion on the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent financial statements does not cover the man-
agement commentary, and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the parent financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the management commentary 
and, in doing so, consider whether the management com-
mentary is materially inconsistent with the consolidated 
financial statements or the parent financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated.
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the 
management commentary provides the information re-
quired under the danish financial business act.
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
the management commentary is in accordance with the 
consolidated financial statements and the parent financial 
statements and has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the danish financial business act. we did 
not identify any material misstatement of the manage-
ment commentary. 
management’s responsibilities for the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the parent financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consoli-
dated financial statements that give a true and fair view in 
alm. brand annual report 2020
47 
auditor’s report
accordance with international financial reporting stand-
ards as adopted by the eu and danish disclosure require-
ments for issuers of listed bonds, and for the preparation 
of parent financial statements that give a true and fair 
view in accordance with the danish financial business act, 
and for such internal control as management determines 
is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements and parent financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.
in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements, management is responsible 
for assessing the group’s and the parent’s ability to con-
tinue as a going concern, disclos-ing, as applicable, mat-
ters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either intends to 
liquidate the group or the parent or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent financial statements 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with isas and the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggre-
gate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements and these parent finan-
cial statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and the ad-
ditional requirements applicable in denmark, we exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional scepti-
cism throughout the audit. we also: 
• 
identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures respon-
sive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. the risk of not detecting a material mis-
statement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
• 
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the group’s and the parent’s internal control. 
• 
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management.
• 
conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting in pre-
paring the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events and conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the group’s and the parent’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. if we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent financial statements or, if such dis-
closures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. however, future 
events or conditions may cause the group and the 
company to cease to continue as a going concern.
• 
evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
contents of the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent financial statements, including the 
disclosures in the notes, and whether the consoli-
dated financial statements and the parent financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.
• 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the group to express an opinion on 
the consolidated financial statements. we are respon-
sible for the direction, supervision and performance 
of the group audit. we remain solely responsible for 
our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, includ-
ing any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.

we also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical re-
quirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and oth-er matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and, 
where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the parent financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. we 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law 
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

some of the life group's investment properties are used by the group as owner-occupied pro-

balance sheet. see note 12.
investment properties non-life and life
the fair value of investment properties is calculated according to the yield method on the basis of 
the operating return on the individual property and a return requirement linked to the individual 
property which reflects the transactions taking place in the property market in the period up to the 
date of valuation.  the resulting fair value is adjusted for deposits, rent above/below market rent, 
rent on vacant premises and deferred maintenance works and necessary refurbishment expenses.
an external appraiser may be engaged where necessary.

the result, positive or negative, is fully allocated to equity.
the return on equity principles are unchanged for 2021, except for the disability insurance group,
return on equity principles
which is now calculated net of reinsurance after bonus.
the executive order on the contribution principle issued by the danish financial supervisory 
authority lays down the guidelines for return on equity. the return on equity is composed of the 
direct return on shareholders’ equity funds, a risk allowance and the result of portfolios without 
bonus entitlement.
customers have been divided into a number of contribution groups based on rate of interest, 
insurance risk and expenses. the risk premium on shareholders’ equity is calculated separately
for each group. similarly, any shadow account, collective bonus potential, transfer and surren-
der charge, etc. will be determined separately for each contribution group.
the risk allowance for 2020 has been determined as follows:
•             interest rate group: 0.3% of average life insurance provisions net of reinsurance 
•             insurance groups: 100% of the risk result net of reinsurance after bo-

loans, advances and receivables at fair value, bonds at fair value, shares etc. and derivatives are measured at fair value in the financial statements so that recognised values equal fair values.
subordinated debt is measured at amortised cost. the difference relative to fair values is assumed to be the interest rate level-independent value adjustment calculated by comparing current market 
rates with the market rates prevailing when the issues were made. as regards the bank’s subordinated debt, changes in fair values due to changes in the bank’s own credit rating are not taken into

the fair value is the price obtained in a sale of an asset or paid for transferring a liability in an arm’s length transaction at the time of measurement. the fair value may be identical to the net asset 
value if the net asset value is calculated on the basis of underlying assets and liabilities measured at fair value. there are three levels of fair value measurement:
level 1 is based on quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets.
level 2 is used where no quoted price is available but where the use of another official price is deemed to best reflect the fair value. in the case of listed securities for which the closing price does not 
represent fair value, valuation techniques or other observable data are used to determine fair value. depending on the nature of the asset or liability, these may be calculations based on underlying
parameters such as yields, exchange rates and volatility or with reference to transaction prices for similar instruments. 
level 3 is used for financial assets and liabilities the valuation of which cannot be based on observable data due to such data not being available or not being deemed to be usable for the determination
of fair value. instead recognised techniques, including discounted cash flows, and internal models and assumptions are used for the determination of fair value. the bank’s unlisted shares that are not
measured at a redistribution price belong to this category. 
the process for recognising fair values has been structured so that effective segregation of duties has been set up between the departments in the group that report, monitor and effect the trans-
actions. reconciliation procedures have been set up for the purpose of identifying material discrepancies across the various reports and source systems used.
transfer between the categories of the fair value hierarchy is only effected in case of changes to available data for use in measurement. the portfolio is reviewed on an ongoing basis to identify any 
changes in available data and any other changes which may have prompted recategorisation. due to a revaluation in 2018, the bank’s subordinated loan of dkk 175 million has been reclassified from
level 2 to level 3. there have been no changes to the data basis. other than this, there were no transfers between categories in the fair value hierarchy in 2019 or 2020.
loans and advances at fair value comprises mortgage deeds measured using a valuation model which estimates the present value of expected future cash flows. the valuation is 
based in part on observable market data (interest rates) and in part on expected future redemption and loss rates. measurement at fair value is based on a swap yield curve plus 50 basis points and 
expected repayment rates between 6.9 % and 12.4 %, depending on whether the counterparty is a commercial or a private customer, and expected loss rates in the 0.75%-4.25% range, depending on 
property type and loan-to-value ratios. if the average expected repayment rate is increased by 1 percentage point and the expected loss rates are increased by 0.5 of a percentage point, a negative 
change of the fair value for the market value model of dkk 15.2 million (2019: dkk 23.0 million). see note 44 accounting policies for additional information.
bonds measured at quoted prices primarily comprise danish mortgage bonds and, to a lesser extent, danish government bonds and corporate bonds. these bonds are attributed to level 1 if a quoted
price is identified within 1-3 trading days before the date of calculation (depending on the type of bond). bonds which are not traded are attributed to level 2. other bonds included in level 2 are those which, 
as a result of lack of market liquidity, are measured based on market rates and yield spreads to these as observed for similar issues. bonds included in level 3 consist of a small amount contributed to a
fund. if the yield increases by 1 percentage point, the value of this bond portfolio will decline by dkk 0.4 million.
bonds at amortised cost comprise a bond which is expected to be held to maturity. the fair value has been measured on the basis of a model calculated price.

shares mainly comprise listed shares and equity futures measured at quoted prices. for unlisted shares in sector-owned companies where the shares are redistributed, such redistribution is considered 
to represent the primary market for the shares. the fair value is determined as the redistribution price, and the shares are recognised as level 2 assets. for other unlisted shares where no observable
input is immediately available, the measurement is based on an estimate which builds on information from the companies’ financial statements, experience from transactions involving shares in the
companies in question as well as input from qualified third parties. the shares are included in level 3. a 10% drop in share prices would cause the value to decline by dkk 49.6 million in aggregate.
other assets comprises interest receivable at dkk 148 million and positive values of derivative financial instruments at dkk 1,383 million. interest rates are measured on the basis of normal principles 
of accrual. derivative financial instruments mainly comprise interest rate swaps, which are measured by way of calculation of the net present value of expected future cash flows discounted on the 
basis of obtainable interest rate points, interpolation between interest rate points and exchange rates. listed futures and options are measured on the basis of obtainable prices. unlisted options are 
measured on the basis of obtainable volatilities, prices of underlying assets and exercise prices using black-scholes. forward exchange transactions are measured on the basis of obtainable forward 
premiums and exchange rates. inflation swaps are measured by way of calculation of the net present value of expected future cash flows discounted on the basis of obtainable index points og interest 
rate points, interpolation between these and exchange rates.
other liabilities comprises interest payable at 46 million and negative values of derivative financial instruments at 491 million. interest rates are measured on the basis of normal principles of accrual. 
derivative financial instruments are valued on the basis of listed prices from an active market and using generally accepted valuation models with observable data, including yield curves, volatilities 
and equity indices.
owner-occupied properties and investment properties are measured in the same way. see note 12 for additional information regarding owneroccupied properties and note 18 for additional information 
about investment properties.

derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value. negative fair values are included under other liabilities, while positive fair values in the banking segment (2019) are
included under other assets and in the other segments under investment assets. financial instruments in the balance sheet are comprised by framework agreements for netting or other agreements.
assets and liabilities are offset when alm. brand and the counterparty have a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and subsequently realise the assets and settle the liability 
simultaneously. alm. brand uses master netting agreements, which entitle the group to offset amounts when a counterparty is in default as the exposure to the counterparty in such a case would be
reduced because of collateral security received. collateral security reduces the exposure if a counterparty is in default, but it does not meet the criteria for offsetting in accordance with ifrs.

note 42    capital and risk management
notes
capital management
the capital management is based on the objective of 
achieving a solid total capital which, in addition to sup-
porting the regulatory requirements, is sufficient to com-
ply with the group-determined requirements to ensure 
that the company is able to absorb a number of major ad-
verse events such as a major windstorm or losses on the 
financial markets without such events having any impact 
on the companies’ other liabilities.
the total capital is composed of shareholders’ equity, tier 
2 capital and the solvency ii capital elements profit mar-
gin and risk margin.
risk management
the objective of risk management in the alm. brand group 
is to ensure that the risks assumed at any given time are 
calculated and reflect the companies’ business strategy, 
risk profile and capital resources. this is achieved through 
identification, measurement via e.g. stress scenarios, 
active management and continuous monitoring of both 
actual and potential risks which the company is exposed 
to during the strategy period.
at least once annually, the board of directors of each indi-
vidual subsidiary determines the company’s overall policy 
for assuming risk and sets up the overall risk guidelines 
as well as the scope of the reporting requirements. the 
board of directors performs an ongoing assessment of the 
individual and aggregate risks in the relevant company and 
in that connection determines whether the risks are ac-
ceptable. on the basis of the board of directors’ powers, 
the management board determines the day-to-day risk 
management. 
the group has several committees ensuring that materi-
al issues are addressed in a uniform manner across the 
group. the group’s central risk forum is a risk committee 
which serves to ensure advice, coordination and uni-
formity in the group companies with respect to accept-
ing, calculating and reporting risk. 
in addition, the investment committee has overall over-
sight with the management of the assets held in the in-
dividual alm. brand companies. this oversight is intend-
ed to ensure that the management is in compliance with 
legislation and with the decisions made by the boards of 
directors of the individual companies. 
the it security committee has overall responsibility for 
the group’s it security and for ensuring that the group 
maintains a balanced it security level and has up-to-
date it security policies and guidelines. the it security 
committee also makes cross-functional decisions and 
decides issues of a fundamental nature and sets up the 
contingency arrangements for the handling of any emer-
gency situations.
the alm. brand group’s risk management is organised 
into three lines of defence. the first line of defence is 
defined as the operative management. the operative 
management is responsible for the ongoing assump-
tion of risks, for the measurement and risk assessment 
of processes, for the establishment of business pro-
cedures, for the effective management of all material 
assignments and day-to-day activities subject to risk as 
well as for compliance with applicable law and internal 
guidelines.
the second line of defence is defined as functions which 
are organised independently of the operative manage-
ment and which monitor and report on risk, including 
validation of the applied risk management methods and 
models. the second line of defence advises the first line 
of defence with respect to the measurement and assessment 
of risk and the structuring of internal controls. in the alm. 
brand group, the second line of defence consists of the risk 
management function, the compliance function, including 
the group’s data protection officer (dpo), and the actuarial 
function.  
the third line of defence is defined as functions which are 
organised independently of the managing director and the 
group directors and of the performance of the tasks in the 
first and second lines of defence. in the alm. brand group, 
the third line of defence consists of department of the inter-
nal auditor and the internal auditing function. the third line of 
defence makes an independent assessment of the operative 
processes, the risk management and the controls estab-
lished. see the description of functions and the audit strategy 
defined by the board of directors.
in addition, a forum for operational risk collates information 
about operational events in the alm. brand group. partici-
pating in this forum are the risk management function, the 
compliance function, it and internal audit. in addition, the 
group has established processes for the handling of new (and 
significantly changed) products to ensure that new risks are 
sufficiently hedged and that business procedures etc. are 
established before implementing new products or activities. 
liquidity management
in connection with the sale of alm. brand bank, the treasury 
function was moved to the group investment function. on a 
day-to-day basis, the investment department monitors and 
manages liquidity based on the liquidity requirement of the 
entire group. the objective of the investment function is to 
ensure that liquidity is at all times sufficient to support op-
erations and comply with the statutory requirements for the 
group companies. compliance with liquidity requirements is 
ensured through internally defined limits. the liquidity man-
alm. brand

alm. brand annual report 2020
financial statements – notes

notes
agement is determined on the basis of a conservative risk 
profile. in addition, there are adequate liquidity resources 
to continually ensure that the group will at any given time 
have the liquidity required to cover day-to-day operations.
risk factors
we take various types of calculated risk in support of the 
group’s long-term business objectives. the content and 
size of risks encountered in the various business areas 
differ considerably, but generally risk parameters for the 
group can be illustrated as shown in the figure below. 
the sections below provide details on the risk scenarios of 
alm. brand forsikring a/s and alm. brand liv og pension 
a/s.
alm. brand forsikring a/s 
in all significant areas, it has been considered what the 
desired risk profile of alm. brand forsikring a/s should 
be. business procedures and controls in that respect have 
been designed and reports are submitted to the board of 
directors and management board of alm. brand forsikring 
a/s on a regular basis.
insurance risks
the primary risks are premium risks (the risk of claims 
expenses and costs exceeding premium income), claims 
provision risks (the risk of provisions being too low relative 
to the ultimate cost of the loss) and catastrophe risks (the 
cost of extreme events). 
rules governing acceptance and writing of new business 
at customer and product level reduce premium risks. 
written risks are assessed for the possibility that several 
policies can be affected by the same loss event (accumu-
lation). moreover, each customer adviser has been given 
instructions as to what risks can be accepted. in addition, 
premium risks are reduced through the use of reinsurance 
and by frequently monitoring trends in tariff parameters. 
the most important reasons for claims provision risks are 
model and calculation uncertainties as to claims provi-
sions and claims inflation. the amount of run-off gains 
and losses is evaluated in the annual actuarial report 
relative to the expectations from the company’s partial 
internal model. this control contributes to providing a true 
and fair view of the risk of run-off losses.
catastrophe risks are covered through reinsurance. the 
purpose of the reinsurance programme is to ensure that 
a single loss event or a random accumulation of large 
losses does not lead to an unacceptable loss of capital 
and, moreover, the purpose is to reduce fluctuations in 
technical results. 
the greatest single risks in alm. brand forsikring are nat-
ural disasters, for which the company’s risk is assessed 
using the partial internal model and a number of scenarios 
based on portfolio exposure and on a calculated probabil-
ity. both components show that the current reinsurance 
programme will provide cover at least for losses resulting 
from a 1:200-year storm.

for 2020, alm. brand forsikring purchased catastrophe 
reinsurance cover for up to dkk 4.3 billion with retention 
of dkk 75 million. reinsurance supplemented by facul-
tative coverage covers fire claims with retention of dkk 
30 million, while personal injury on accident and workers’ 
compensation claims are covered with retention of dkk 
20 million. in addition, frequency cover has been taken out 
against major fire events and against extraordinarily many 
windstorm and precipitation events (cloudbursts, snow 
load etc.). 
from 1 july 2019, the risk of a terrorist attack is covered 
under a state terrorism insurance scheme, comprising 
claims related to attacks involving nuclear, biological or 
chemical agents. alm. brand therefore no longer covers 
these risks, but still covers claims related to conventional 
terrorist attacks, which are also covered under the com-
pany’s catastrophe reinsurance programme.
health insurance risks
health insurance risk arises as a result of the insurance 
group’s writing of workers’ compensation and personal 
accident insurance. these policies all give rise to both 
premium, claims provision and catastrophe risks, as de-
scribed in the section on non-life insurance risks.
particularly workers’ compensation insurance is affected 
by legislative amendments and changed legal practice 
as well as by social inflation. social inflation means that 
claims expenses increase due to developments in social 
and socio-economic factors. such factors have a tenden-
cy to drive up the number of insurance-covered claims 
and average claims expenses. these external risk factors 
arise due to trends in society and are difficult to predict, 
thereby making it difficult to price health insurance risks 
correctly.
because workers’ compensation insurance is of a longer-
tail nature and because the legislative framework is more 
complicated, the potential impact of risk factors on the 
results of workers’ compensation lines is greater than in 
personal accident lines. 
market risks
the management of market risk is intended to ensure 
achievement of an optimum return without putting the 
total capital of alm. brand forsikring at risk of significant 
deterioration due to financial market developments or 
financial difficulties of individual issuers.
the asset allocation of alm. brand forsikring at 31 de-
cember 2020 reflects its focus on stable returns and low 
investment risk.  the investment assets of alm. brand 
forsikring are predominantly placed in interest-bearing 
assets, most of which are danish mortgage bonds with a 
high credit rating. the average duration is between two 
and three years. 
the interest rate risk on assets and liabilities is monitored 
and adjusted on an ongoing basis. interest rate swaps 
are used to adjust the interest rate risk on the assets. 
throughout 2020, the risk profile was more or less neutral 
relative to interest rate changes. 
 
in late 2014, alm. brand forsikring acquired most of alm. 
brand bank’s portfolio of mortgage deeds. the transac-
tion contained an option agreement to protect alm. brand 
forsikring against future credit losses. this means that 
alm. brand forsikring can deliver back mortgage deeds 
if the mortgage deed debtors default on their payment ob-
ligations. in connection with the sale of alm. brand bank 
a/s on 30 november 2020 to sydbank a/s, this option 
was taken over by alm. brand pia a/s. this means that pia 
retains the credit risk, whereas alm. brand forsikring only 
assumes the market risk associated with investing in the 
mortgage deeds. 
about 4% of the total portfolio of investment assets is 
placed in equities, and less than 1% of the assets are 
placed in unlisted equities, primarily in the form of stra-
tegic sector equities. sector equities are held for the pur-
pose of supporting the insurance activities. in the event of 
a 15% decline in equity prices, alm. brand forsikring’s eq-
uity and results at 31 december 2020 would be adversely 
affected by dkk 57 million.
the currency risk of alm. brand forsikring covers an ex-
posure to emerging market government bonds of about 
dkk 200 million, an exposure of about dkk 1,200 million 
to euro-denominated equities, european credit bonds, 
property funds and market values of derivative fixed-in-
come instruments denominated in foreign currency and a 
currency risk related to global equities of less than dkk 50 
million. alm. brand forsikring pursues a hedging strategy 
for currency positions in the company’s equity mandates 
which are not invested in euro or danish kroner.
counterparty risks
counterparty risk arises when a counterparty in a financial 
agreement fails to meet its obligations. counterparty risk 
is broken down into two types in the solvency calculation. 
type 1 counterparty risk covers exposure to large financial 
enterprises, for instance due to reinsurance agreements 
or financial contracts. type 2 counterparty risk covers the 
risk that insurance customers or insurance brokers fail to 
pay what they owe to alm. brand forsikring.
type 1 counterparty risk related to reinsurance is the un-
certainty associated with the situation that one or more of

notes
alm. brand forsikring’s reinsurers go into insolvent liqui-
dation, resulting in a full or partial loss of receivables and 
in new coverage of the business having to be purchased. 
in order to minimise the risk related to each reinsurer, re-
insurers must be rated at least a- with standard & poor’s 
or a.m. best. deviations from this rating must be approved 
by the board of directors. 
financial counterparties are most often credit institutions 
in which case the receivable arises in a bilateral derivative 
agreement or, for instance, by depositing cash funds in a 
bank account, which creates a type 1 counterparty risk. 
placement limits contain restrictions as to the companies’ 
maximum receivable from specific credit institutions.
alm. brand forsikring limits counterparty risks in connec-
tion with derivative agreements by entering into margin 
agreements and netting with the counterparties. margin 
agreements ensure that collateral is provided when the 
exposure exceeds a certain level. netting is described in 
the isda master agreements and implies that gains and 
losses on derivative financial instruments may be offset 
if a counterparty breaches its obligations. agreements on 
derivative financial instruments of a longer-term nature 
can only be concluded if they also have a netting agree-
ment with collateral provided. if deemed expedient, devi-
ations from this general rule may in rare circumstances be 
accepted subject to management consent. 
in addition, alm. brand forsikring has type 1 counter-
party risk on alm. brand pia. this is due to alm. brand 
forsikring’s option to sell back delinquent mortgage deeds 
to alm. brand pia a/s. 
other risks
liquidity risk is very limited because premiums in the 
company are pre-paid. non-life insurance is under the 
greatest liquidity pressure after a weather-related event, 
but may procure liquidity within a short period by selling 
assets.
alm. brand liv og pension a/s
life insurance risks
biometric risks consist of mortality, longevity, disability, 
catastrophe risk, costs and option risk (risk related to the 
scope of surrender and re-writing to paid-up policies). 
disability and mortality risks are limited by guidelines for 
how large a risk the company may accept. alm. brand liv 
og pension a/s generally does not write covers without 
personal health information being provided, although 
there are a few exceptions to this general rule. effective 
1 november 2019, alm. brand signed up to the insurance 
industry’s common principles on acceptance and contin-
uation in the event of a change of provider of corporate 
pension schemes (the change-of-provider agreement) 
as part of the company’s growth strategy. receipt of 
schemes under the change-of-provider agreement is 
based on more lenient health information in the form of 
an employer’s statement. alm. brand liv og pension also 
has a single product of a limited scope in which corporate 
pension schemes are offered against provision of limited 
personal health information. moreover, risks are limited 
through a reinsurance programme which mitigates the 
effects of losses incurred on large customers. the reinsur-
ance programme also comprises catastrophe cover in the 
event of several customers being hit by the same event.
to cover any future fluctuations in biometric risks, a risk 
margin is added to market value provisions. the risk mar-
gin has been determined on the basis of the value of the 
cost of capital charge for future solvency capital require-
ments (the so-called cost of capital approach of solvency

ii). the market value parameters for use in the calculation 
of market value provisions are assessed at least once a 
year.
alm. brand liv og pension’s breakdown into contribution 
groups means that generally there is no collective bonus 
potential in the contribution groups for mortality, longev-
ity and disability, respectively. this generally implies that 
losses incurred in these groups will be paid through equity. 
however, the overall buffers may be applied through the 
use of negative bonus, thereby limiting the risk to the reac-
tion rate of bonus rate adjustments.

notes
alm. brand liv og pension has a relatively small exposure 
to longevity, as the portfolio is predominantly composed 
of capital, retirement and instalment pension schemes. 
the calculation of provisions is based on the danish 
financial supervisory authority’s benchmark for longevity 
assumptions adjusted to reflect the company’s own ex-
perience. the solvency ii standard formula is used for the 
assessment of longevity risk.
health insurance risks
new health and personal accident business in alm. 
brand liv og pension is written outside the framework of 
guaranteed interest, ensuring that the customers receive 
a sharper but also more flexible insurance price. these 
policies give rise to both premium, claims provision and 
catastrophe risks but are also affected by legislative 
amendments and changed legal practice as well as by 
social inflation. social inflation means that claims expens-
es increase due to developments in social and socio-eco-
nomic factors.  premium risk is limited to a maximum of 
one year due to the possibility of a quick change of price
market risks
for 2020, alm. brand liv og pension’s insurance portfo-
lio is divided into five interest rate contribution groups 
characterised by the different guarantee levels on which 
the insurances are based. the investment strategies of the 
individual interest rate contribution groups are carefully 
designed to match the investment buffers and guarantees 
of each individual group. 
the current level of interest rates still makes it difficult 
to achieve an investment return that matches the high 
guarantee levels. however, the high guarantee levels will 
be reduced significantly over time. alm. brand liv og pen-
sion has introduced the principle that the full amount of 
any surplus on the policies’ interest rate, risk or expense 
results must be used to lower the future required rate of 
return on the insurances. this gradually reduces the guar-
antees for the interest rate groups and has the effect that, 
over time, they will be moved to interest rate groups with 
lower guarantees. 
no new business is written in the four highest contribu-
tion groups, which mainly consist of insurances under 
disbursement or close to retirement, and the portfolio is 
thus gradually reduced. at 31 december 2020, the closed 
portfolios accounted for approximately 32% of total provi-
sions in the contribution portfolio.
at least once a month and otherwise as needed, alm. 
brand liv og pension calculates the solvency capital re-
quirement and the expected profit for the year. in addi-
tion, sensitivity analyses are carried out according to a se-
lection of economic scenarios (e.g. combinations of a rise 
or fall in interest rates, decline in equities and a widening 
of the credit spread (oas)). 
in the event of a 1 percentage point interest rate in-
crease, alm. brand liv og pension’s equity and results at 
31 december 2020 would be adversely affected by dkk 22 
million. the company’s equity and results are not exposed 
to changes in equity or property values unless in the event 
of very severe fluctuations.
the asset allocation of alm. brand liv og pension is diver-
sified across a number of asset classes. the risk tolerance 
is calculated relative to the total assets and allocated to 
each portfolio according to size. the risk tolerance can 
thus be measured regardless of the guarantees issued in 
each interest rate contribution group. this has the conse-
quence that groups with large investment buffers will have 
more higher-risk assets than groups with low investment 
buffers, as the overall risk exposure for shareholders’ eq-
uity must be identical.   
derivatives are used to adjust the interest rate risk of 
the individual contribution groups in order to achieve the 
desired risk profile between assets and liabilities for each 
interest rate contribution group. the greatest interest 
risk arises in the event of a sudden and severe interest 
rate fall, giving the company no time to adjust its hedging 
activities. the duration of provisions increases with the 
decline in interest rates.
equity exposure is only accepted on investment equities 
for policyholders’ funds, and the exposure is accepted on 
the basis of a global investment universe. in addition, alm. 
brand liv og pension holds a limited number of unlisted 
equities, primarily in the form of strategic sector equities. 
these equities are held for the purpose of supporting the 
business activities. 
property exposure is accepted only for policyholders’ 
funds. most of the property investments are owner-occu-
pied properties. in 2018, the board of directors approved 
investments in european property funds. the board of 
directors approved additional investments in 2020. about 
half of the approved total amount was invested in 2020, 
and the rest is expected to be invested in 2021. this will 
increase diversification for property investments as well as 
for the overall asset portfolio. the risk profile defined for 
the purchasing and selling of property, including funds, is 
focused on a high degree of security and stable returns on 
a long-term horizon.

counterparty risks
counterparty risk often arises due to a receivable in 
connection with a bilateral derivative agreement or, for 
instance, by depositing cash funds in a bank account with 
a credit institution. placement limits contain restrictions 
as to how large an exposure a company may have with 
specific credit institutions.
  
alm. brand liv og pension limits counterparty risks in 
connection with derivative agreements by entering into 
margin agreements and netting with its counterparties. 
margin agreements ensure that collateral is provided when 
the exposure exceeds a certain level. netting is described 
in the isda master agreements and implies that gains and 
losses on derivative financial instruments may be offset 
if a counterparty breaches its obligations. agreements on 
derivative financial instruments of a longer-term nature 
can only be concluded if they also have a netting agree-
ment with collateral provided. if deemed expedient, devi-
ations from this general rule may in rare circumstances be 
accepted subject to management consent. 
other risks
the liquidity risk is very limited. the greatest liquidity 
risk is the risk of a large number of customers wanting to 
move their pension savings at the same time. should this 
materialise, the company may procure liquidity within a 
short period by selling assets and may furthermore miti-
gate the risk to a certain extent by introducing a transfer 
and surrender charge. 
 
other risks facing the group
operational risk arises as a result of inexpedient or faulty 
internal procedures, human or system errors or as a 
result of external events, including legal risks. the group 
has a number of control procedures in the form of work 
routines, business procedures and reconciliation pro-
cesses, performed locally and centrally throughout the 
organisation. the scope of control measures is assessed 
against the expenses they involve. security measures are 
assessed relative to potential threats and their assessed 
probability of occurrence as well as the potential business 
consequences, should such threats materialise. 
with a view to reducing risks relative to the gdpr rules, 
the group has a number of common procedures to ac-
commodate requests for access to and erasure of data 
etc. and to handle and report personal data breaches to 
the danish data protection agency. the group has also 
appointed a common data protection adviser, providing 
advice to the group and overseeing gdpr compliance.
the group is continually making proactive efforts to re-
duce the number of potential events that could give rise 
to poor reputation. moreover, the group is focused on 
reducing the number of complaints involving alm. brand 
forsikring filed with the insurance complaints board, and 
even though the insurance company has a track record of 
winning most of the complaints filed, every complaint is 
one too many because it means that the group has a dis-
satisfied customer. alm. brand forsikring has a customer 
ambassador who reviews the complaints. the customer 
ambassador looks at a complaint from a customer point 
of view and is responsible for ensuring that the customers’ 
views are heard. this is done to promote a good dialogue 
between alm. brand forsikring and its customers. often a 
disagreement arises because the customer has not been 
adequately informed about why his or her claim is not 
covered. the complaints are subsequently analysed, ena-
bling the group to develop its insurance products and to 
become better at explaining its current insurance terms. 
strategic risks arise due to inexpedient business deci-
sions, insufficient implementation of business initiatives or 
slow response to the challenges facing the group. 
strategic risks cannot be avoided but they can be limited 
by maintaining high professional standards, openness and 
willingness to change in the organisation. alm. brand’s 
strategy has been prepared by the group management on 
the basis of a structured process and in cooperation with 
each group subsidiary’s board of directors, management 
board and managerial groups. 
regulatory risks play an increasingly large role for the 
general public as well as for alm. brand, and non-compli-
ance is becoming an increasingly important factor – also 
for customers. for instance, this applies to the eu rules 
under solvency ii, anti-money laundering directives, the 
general data protection regulation (gdpr) and danish 
delegated legislation. the regulatory and strategic risks 
are monitored and assessed on an ongoing basis, but they 
are typically not directly measurable.
the group’s risk profile and risk management are de-
scribed in detail at almbrand.dk/risiko.

note 43   significant accounting estimates, assumptions and uncertainties
notes
the valuation of unlisted shares is based on information 
from the companies’ financial statements, experience 
from transactions involving shares in the companies in 
question as well as input from qualified third parties.  
valuation of mortgage deed portfolios
the mortgage deed portfolios are valued partly on the 
basis of non-observable input and are therefore to some 
extent subject to estimates. the calculation of the fair val-
ue of mortgage deeds is based on models which include 
parameters such as expected prepayments, loss rates and 
interest rate level. 
non-delinquent mortgage deeds are measured on the 
basis of the number of assumptions relating to required 
rate of return, expected credit losses and repayments – 
assumptions basically concerning what a mortgage deed 
could trade for between two independent parties. the 
model will revalue the mortgage deed if the mortgage 
deed coupon is higher than the discount rate. such reval-
uation is sensitive to the model assumptions.
the repayment rates are updated on an ongoing basis to 
reflect the development in realised repayments. 
delinquent mortgage deeds are valued with due consid-
eration for the risk of default and the loss incurred in the 
event of default. any unsecured part is written down, and 
the amount depends, among other things, on how long 
the mortgage deed has been delinquent. however, the 
unsecured part must be written down to zero after the 
mortgage deed has been delinquent for a period of 180 
days. the unsecured part is calculated on the basis of the 
underlying property value. either an external individual 
valuation or an internal valuation based on retrieved ref-
erence value of similar properties is used to measure the 
specific property value.
non-life insurance
liabilities under insurance contracts are measured based 
on a number of actuarial calculations, applying, among 
other things, assumptions on a number of variables. the 
liabilities are furthermore affected by the discount rate.
the provisions for workers’ compensation insurance are af-
fected by several acts. the danish social pensions act was 
amended in december 2020, whereby the state retirement 
age was raised from 68 to 69 years for people born on or 
after 1 january 1967. the act also imposes a duty on the 
minister for social affairs in 2025 to reassess whether the 
retirement age should be raised further. 
an expert committee has been set up, which has made 
proposals in connection with a revision of the danish act 
on industrial injuries. the most recent legislative amend-
ment at 1 january 2020 concerning the accident concept 
is assessed to be the first step of this revision, but the 
process of revising the legislation is still ongoing with 
the involvement of e.g. the danish insurance association 
(forsikring & pension). it is still uncertain which recom-
mendations will be implemented in legislation – including 
how the senior pension proposed by the danish govern-
ment will affect the claims level – and the amount of 
claims expenses arising as a result of a potential revision 
of the act is therefore subject to uncertainty.
alm. brand forsikring reserves capital with due regard to 
all known and unknown factors which may impact the 
level of claims. 
the preparation of the financial statements involves the 
use of accounting estimates. such estimates are made 
by the company’s management in accordance with the 
accounting policies and on the basis of historical expe-
rience and assumptions, which management considers 
prudent and realistic but which are inherently uncertain 
and unpredictable. 
the most significant estimates are related to the calcu-
lation of fair values of unlisted financial instruments and 
receivables. in addition, significant estimates are applied 
in the valuation of mortgage deeds and liabilities under 
insurance contracts. 
this note should be read in conjunction with note 35, 
which contains information about the determination of fair 
value. 
financial instruments
significant estimates are not used for the valuation of 
financial instruments where the valuation is based on 
prices quoted in an active market or on generally accept-
ed valuation models employing observable market data.
valuations of financial instruments that are only to a limit-
ed extent based on observable market data are subject to 
estimates. this applies for example to unlisted shares and 
certain bonds for which an active market does not exist. 
for securities that are not listed on a stock exchange, or 
for which no price is quoted that reflects the fair value of 
the instrument, the fair value is determined using a model 
calculation. 
the valuation models include the discounting of the in-
strument cash flow using an appropriate market rate.

alpha insurance 
the insurance company alpha insurance was declared 
bankrupt on 8 may 2018. the obligations vis-à-vis persons 
injured in connection with an industrial accident have 
been transferred to arbejdsmarkedets erhvervssikring 
(aes). under workers’ compensation legislation and as a 
result of the company’s workers’ compensation insurance 
portfolio, alm. brand forsikring has an obligation to cover 
a market share-based proportion of the workers’ com-
pensation insurance claims which the aes is unable to 
recover from the estate in bankruptcy.
alm. brand has made a reserve based on an estimate of 
the company’s share of the total expenses after dividend 
from the estate in bankruptcy. the ultimate net expense is 
affected by a number of factors, which remain subject to 
great uncertainty. this applies, among other things, to the 
adequacy of alpha’s gross provisions for workers’ compen-
sation claims and the value of the assets on realisation. a 
significant part of the assets are receivables from alpha’s 
reinsurers, and the uncertainty in this respect concerns 
the value of the receivables and the distribution by the 
estate in bankruptcy of the receivables when realised. 
moreover, there is uncertainty with respect to the total 
expenses for claims handling and for the winding up of 
the estate as well as to alm. brand’s market share-based 
proportion of the expenses.
life insurance
liabilities under insurance contracts are measured based 
on a number of actuarial calculations, applying, among 
other things, assumptions about a number of variables. 
the liabilities are furthermore affected by the discount 
rate.
note 43  significant accounting estimates, assumptions and uncertainties – continued
alm. brand liv og pension is focused on hedging the 
guaranteed benefits provided, applying derivative finan-
cial instruments to ensure that interest rate exposures on 
assets and liabilities are more or less aligned. changes in 
the value of investment assets resulting from changes in 
interest rates are therefore partly offset by correspond-
ing changes in the value of the technical provisions and 
the individual and collective bonus potentials. if, over 
time, the return generated is lower than the discount rate 
applied, the bonus potentials will be affected initially, and 
shareholders’ equity may be affected subsequently. 
properties
in connection with the valuation of properties, a fair value 
is calculated on the basis of market-based rental income 
the table lists the most important risks to which the alm. brand group is exposed. the order of the risk factors is not an indication of the 
size or importance of each risk factor. the risk factors relating to life insurance do not include risks related to securities owned by the poli-

general 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with the international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu. the parent company 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the provisions of the danish financial business act, 
including the executive order on financial reporting for 
insurance companies and multi-employer occupational
pension funds. in addition, the consolidated financial 
statements have been presented in accordance with ad-
ditional danish disclosure requirements for listed financial 
enterprises. 
additional danish disclosure requirements for annu-
al financial statements are for the group set out in the 
danish statutory order on adoption of ifrs for financial 
enterprises issued pursuant to the danish financial busi-
ness act and by nasdaq copenhagen a/s. for the parent 
company, the disclosure requirements are defined in the 
danish financial business act and by nasdaq copenha-
gen a/s. 
the annual financial statements are presented in danish 
kroner (dkk), which is considered the primary currency of 
the group’s activities and the functional currency of the 
parent company. 
the accounting policies applied in the consolidated 
financial statements are described in the following. the 
accounting policies of the parent company are described 
as part of the parent company’s financial statements. 
profit margin of alm. brand liv og pension
the sector has been in discussions with the danish finan-
cial supervisory authority about the accounting concept 
“profit margin”. the outcome is an understanding that the 
danish financial supervisory authority requires a theo-
retically more sophisticated methodology for calculating 
the profit margin. as a result, alm. brand has initiated 
a process to ensure that the company adapts to these 
requirements well in advance of the implementation of the 
danish financial supervisory authority’s new approach. 
the new calculation principles are not expected to change 
the company’s capital robustness.
standards and interpretations not yet in 
force 
at the date of publication of these financial statements, 
a number of new or amended standards have not yet 
entered into force and/or been adopted for use in the eu 
and are therefore not included in these financial state-
ments. alm. brand does not expect to implement the 
new accounting standards and interpretations until they 
become mandatory. except for the ones set out below, 
none of the new standards or interpretations are expected 
to have a significant impact on the financial reporting of 
the group.
ifrs 17 insurance contracts
in may 2017, the iasb issued ifrs 17, insurance con-
tracts. ifrs 17 replaces ifrs 4, insurance contracts. the 
new ifrs standard will have a significant impact on the 
measurement, presentation and information concerning 
insurance contracts. the commencement date is currently 
1 january 2023. the effects of the new standard will be 
analysed and assessed over the coming years.
basis of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements comprise the par-
ent company and subsidiaries in which the parent com-
pany holds the majority of the voting rights or otherwise 
holds a controlling interest. companies in which the group 
holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights or other-
wise exercises a significant but not a controlling influence 
are considered associates.
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
by consolidating items of a uniform nature in the income 
statements and balance sheets of each company. inter-
company income, expenses, intra-group accounts, share-
holdings and gains and losses on transactions between 
the consolidated enterprises are eliminated.
properties owned by subsidiaries and used by the group 
are reclassified from investment property to owner-occu-
pied property.
the financial statements of subsidiary undertakings that 
present annual reports under other jurisdictions have been 
restated to the accounting policies applied by the group.
in the preparation of the consolidated financial state-
ments, accounting items of subsidiaries are fully recog-
nised, regardless of the percentage of ownership. the 
proportionate shares of the results and equity of subsid-
iary undertakings attributable to minority interests are 
recognised as separate items in the income statement 
and the balance sheet. intra-group services are settled 
on market terms or on a cost recovery basis. intra-group 
financial statements carry interest on market terms. in-
tra-group transactions in securities and other assets are 
settled at market prices.
the consolidated financial statements of alm. brand a/s 
are included in the consolidated financial statements of 
alm. brand af 1792 fmba, copenhagen.

general recognition and measurement policies
assets are recognised in the balance sheet when, due 
to a previous event, it is probable that future economic 
benefits will flow to the group and the value of the asset 
can be reliably measured. liabilities are recognised in the 
balance sheet when, due to a previous event, it is proba-
ble that future economic benefits will flow from the group 
and the value of the liability can be reliably measured.
otherwise, assets and liabilities are recognised and meas-
ured as described for each individual item below.
income is recognised in the income statement as earned, 
whereas costs are recognised by the amounts attributable 
to the financial year. value adjustments of financial assets 
and liabilities are recorded in the income statement un-
less otherwise described in the accounting policies.
recognition and measurement take into account predict-
able losses and risks occurring before the presentation of 
the annual report and which confirm or invalidate condi-
tions existing at the balance sheet date.
financial instruments are measured at fair value on initial 
recognition at the settlement date. changes to the value 
of the asset acquired or sold during the period from the 
transaction date to the settlement date are included as 
derivative financial instruments. if the acquired item is 
measured at cost or amortised cost after initial recogni-
tion, any value changes during the period from the trans-
action date to the settlement date are not recognised.
certain financial assets and liabilities are measured at 
amortised cost, implying the recognition of a constant ef-
fective rate of interest to maturity. amortised cost is stat-
ed as original cost less any principal payments and plus 
or minus the accumulated amortisation of any difference 
between cost and the nominal amount. this method allo-
cates capital gains and losses over the term to maturity.
financial assets and liabilities are classified on the basis 
of the business model and the contractual cash flows 
related to the financial assets and liabilities.
financial assets are measured subsequent to initial recog-
nition at amortised cost if they are held in order to collect 
the contractual cash flows and if the contractual cash 
flows are solely payments of interest and principal on the 
principal amount outstanding.  
financial assets are generally measured according to 
the time of initial recognition at fair value through other 
comprehensive income if the financial assets are held in 
a mixed business model in which some financial assets 
are held to collect the contractual cash flows and other 
financial assets are sold and if the contractual cash flows 
are solely payments of interest and principal on the prin-
cipal amount outstanding. however, the relevant financial 
assets form part of a risk management system and an 
investment strategy based on fair values and on that basis 
form part of alm. brand’s internal management reporting. 
against this background, alm. brand assesses that the 
financial assets do not satisfy the criteria of a business 
model relating to the measurement categories amortised 
cost and fair value through other comprehensive income. 
the relevant financial assets are instead measured at fair 
value through profit or loss.
if financial assets do not satisfy the above-mentioned 
business model criteria or if the contractual cash flows 
are not solely payments of interest and principal on the 
principal amount outstanding, the financial assets will 
subsequent to initial recognition be measured at fair value 
through profit or loss. 
below is a description of the accounting policies applied 
to financial assets and liabilities as well as other items.
foreign currency
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency 
are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the 
balance sheet date. income and expenses denominated in 
foreign currency are recognised at the rates of exchange 
ruling at the transaction date. exchange gains and losses 
are recognised in the income statement.
tax
all companies in the group are jointly taxed.
tax includes tax for the year, comprising income tax paya-
ble for the year, movements in deferred tax and prior-year 
adjustments. changes in deferred tax resulting from 
changes in tax rates are also recognised in this item. 
current tax assets and liabilities are recognised in the bal-
ance sheet at the amount that can be calculated on the 
basis of the expected taxable income for the year adjusted 
for prior years’ tax losses carried forward.
 
deferred tax is recognised according to the balance sheet 
liability method on all temporary differences between the 
carrying amount and tax base of assets and liabilities. 
deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax regula-
tions and tax rates that, according to the rules in force at 
the balance sheet date, will apply at the time the deferred 
tax is expected to crystallise as current tax.

notes
deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax losses 
carried forward, are measured at the amount at which 
they are expected to be realised, either as a set-off 
against tax on future income or as a set-off against 
deferred tax liabilities. at each balance sheet date, it is 
reassessed whether it is likely that there will be sufficient 
future taxable income for the deferred tax asset to be 
utilised.
income statement
premium income
gross premiums comprise premiums due relating to insur-
ance and contracts.
premium income, net of reinsurance, is the gross premi-
ums for the year adjusted for movements in unearned 
premium provisions, profit margin and the part of the risk 
margin attributable to unearned premium provisions, and 
less reinsurers’ share. the part of the change in unearned 
premium provisions, profit margin and risk margin which 
is attributable to the bond maturity effect is transferred to 
interest expenses, etc. the part of the change in unearned 
premium provisions, profit margin and risk margin which is 
attributable to a change in the discount rate applied after 
inflation is transferred to market value adjustments.
premiums relating to life insurance comprise premiums 
due during the year and single premiums less labour mar-
ket contribution. 
interest income, etc. 
interest income and dividends, etc. includes dividends 
received and interest earned during the financial year. 
the item also includes interest-like fees and commissions 
that are an integral part of the effective rate of interest on 
financial assets measured at amortised cost. finally, the 
item recognises the part of the change in unearned premi-
um provisions and outstanding claims provisions that can 
be ascribed to discounting.
other income from investment activities
the item includes the operating profit on investment 
property after deduction of related administrative expens-
es. 
other income
this item includes income derived from activities that 
cannot be attributed to the group’s principal activities.
claims expenses
claims expenses include claims paid during the insurance 
year adjusted for movements in claims provisions corre-
sponding to known and anticipated claims relating to the 
year. also included is any change in the part of the risk 
margin attributable to claims provisions.
amounts to cover expenses for surveying and assessment 
and other direct or indirect staff administration costs, etc. 
associated with claims handling are included in the item. 
in addition, the item includes run-off results regarding 
previous years.
the group’s indirect costs relating to the handling of 
claims are distributed between claims expenses and 
administrative expenses using allocation keys based on 
estimated resource application.
the part of the change in outstanding claims provisions 
and risk margin which can be attributed to discounting 
is transferred to interest expenses, etc. the part of the 
change in outstanding claims provisions and risk mar-
gin which can be attributed to a change in the discount 
rate applied after inflation is transferred to market value 
adjustments.
alm. brand forsikring a/s has entered into swap agree-
ments to partially hedge provisions for workers’ compen-
sation against changes in the future wage index, assuming 
continued stable growth in the real value of claims paid. 
the value adjustment of these swaps is included in claims 
incurred.
claims and benefits relating to life insurance comprise 
benefits due during the year, amounts paid for repurchas-
es and bonus amounts paid in cash.
other expenses from investment activities
the item includes amounts associated with the manage-
ment of investment assets. brokerage and commission re-
lating to the purchase and sale of securities is recognised 
under market value adjustments.
acquisition costs and administrative expenses
the part of the insurance operation expenses that can 
be ascribed to acquisition and renewal of the insurance 
portfolio is recognised under acquisition costs. acquisi-
tion costs are generally charged to the income statement 
when the insurance takes effect. 
administrative expenses comprise expenses related to 
managing the company’s activities. administrative expens-
es are accrued to match the financial year.
operating expenses relating to owner-occupied prop-
erties are recognised in the consolidated income state-
ment under administrative expenses. rent concerning the 
company’s owner-occupied properties is not recognised

in the consolidated income statement, but the expense is 
included in the individual segment financial statements.
other expenses
expenses associated with activities that cannot be as-
cribed to the company’s principal activities are recognised 
under other expenses.
result of ceded business
for reinsurance contracts containing a combination of 
financial terms and traditional terms with transfer of risk, 
the risk premium is recognised on an accruals basis under 
premium income. the accrual is based on the value of the 
contracts at the end of the year. realised losses relating 
to these contracts are included in claims after adjustment 
for movements in financial deposits. 
reinsurance premiums ceded and reinsurers’ share re-
ceived are accrued and recognised in the income state-
ment according to the same principles as those applied 
for the corresponding items under the gross business.
changes in ceded business attributable to discounting 
are transferred to interest expenses, etc., while changes 
attributable to changes in the discount rate applied are 
transferred to value adjustments.
value adjustments
value adjustments include all realised and unrealised 
gains and losses on investment assets, except for value 
adjustment of subsidiary and associated undertakings and 
revaluations of owner-occupied properties. the item also 
includes the discounting effect of insurance contracts.
tax on pension returns
tax on pension returns includes the tax levied on returns 
relating to the group’s life insurance activities, notwith-
standing whether the tax is payable now or at a later date.
balance sheet
intangible assets
intangible assets are measured at the lower of cost 
less accumulated amortisation and impairment and the 
recoverable amount. intangible assets are amortised on 
a straight-line basis over an expected useful life not ex-
ceeding five years. 
in determining cost, all costs that are directly attributable 
to development and that will probably generate economic 
benefits for the group are recognised. all other costs are 
expensed as incurred. amortisation and impairment are 
recognised as administrative expenses.
land and buildings
land and buildings owned by the group are classified as 
either investment properties or owner-occupied prop-
erties. owner-occupied properties comprise proper-
ties which alm. brand generally uses for administrative 
purposes. other properties are classified as investment 
properties.
the fair value of land and buildings is assessed on an 
annual basis. an external appraiser may be engaged where 
necessary.
investment properties
investment properties are measured at a fair value calcu-
lated in accordance with the guidelines issued by the dan-
ish financial supervisory authority. the fair value is cal-
culated on the basis of the yield method, which involves a 
valuation of each individual property on the basis of an ex-
pected normal operating budget and a rate of return. the 
calculated value is adjusted for short-term circumstances 
which change the earnings of the property. the adjusted 
calculated value corresponds to the fair value. 
adjustments of the value of investment properties are 
recognised in the income statement in the financial year 
when the change occurred. 
owner-occupied properties
owner-occupied properties are measured at a revalued 
amount corresponding to the fair value at the revaluation 
date less accumulated depreciation and value adjust-
ments. the fair value is calculated on the basis of the 
danish financial supervisory authority’s guidelines on the 
yield method, which involves the measurement of each 
individual property on the basis of an expected normal op-
erating budget and a rate of return. the calculated value is 
adjusted for short-term circumstances which change the 
earnings of the property. the adjusted calculated value 
corresponds to the fair value.
owner-occupied properties are depreciated on a straight-
line basis over the expected useful life of the properties, 
which is estimated to be 60 years. depreciation is cal-
culated with due consideration to the expected residual 
value and is recognised in the income statement under 
administrative expenses. 
revaluations with the addition or deduction of the tax 
effect, including properties classified as owner-occupied 
properties, are made through other comprehensive income 
and tied in revaluation reserves. if a revaluation can no 
longer be maintained, it is reversed. writedowns that do 
not offset previous revaluations are made in the income 
statement.

the part of the revaluations that can be attributed to in-
surance contracts with bonus entitlement is subsequently 
transferred to collective bonus potential in accordance 
with the contribution rules filed.
the yield method
the operating budget recognises rental income from full 
letting, as any rent for vacant premises or other lack of 
rental income is offset against the estimated value. ac-
cordingly, the operating budget recognises normal main-
tenance of the property. any major anticipated renovation 
work, restoration work or repair is offset against the 
estimated value.
the rate of return is determined based on current market 
conditions for the type of property taking into account the 
state of repair, location, use, leases, etc. 
reinsurers’ share from insurance contracts
the reinsurers’ share of the technical provisions is cal-
culated as the amounts expected to be received from 
reinsurance companies under the applicable reinsurance 
contracts.
the group regularly assesses its reinsurance assets for im-
pairment. if there is a clear indication of impairment, the 
carrying amount of the asset is written down.
other assets
other assets comprise various receivables and prepay-
ments as well as assets comprised by ifrs 16 leases. the 
item also comprises positive fair value of spot trans-
actions and derivative financial instruments, operating 
equipment and assets taken over temporarily. 
forward transactions, futures, swaps, options and un-
settled spot transactions are measured at fair value on 
initial and subsequent recognition. positive and negative 
fair values of derivatives are recognised as other assets or 
other liabilities, respectively. changes in the fair value of 
derivatives are recognised in the income statement.
the loss option issued to cover credit losses on mortgage 
deeds in alm. brand forsikring a/s is measured using the 
credit model, which is also used for the measurement of 
the group’s other delinquent mortgage deeds. 
prepayments comprises expenses incurred prior to the 
balance sheet date but which relate to a subsequent ac-
counting period.
leasing
on conclusion of a contract, an assessment is made of 
whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. this is es-
tablished based on the following assumptions:
• 
the underlying asset may be identified;
• 
the group is entitled to obtain all economic benefits 
from use of the asset;
• 
the group is entitled to direct the use of the asset.
alm. brand recognises a right of use or similar liability for 
all leases. if the group is the lessee, however, short-term 
leases (12 months or less) or leases of low-value assets 
are not included.
upon commencement or reassessment of a contract con-
taining lease components, a right of use (rou asset) and 
a lease liability are recognised. rou assets are measured 
at initial cost, comprising the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for
• 
lease payments made at or prior to commencement;
• 
any direct costs;
• 
lease incentives received;
• 
estimated term of the contract.
rou assets are tested for impairment in the event of 
changes to the contractual basis etc.
furniture and equipment, computers, cars, etc. 
operating equipment is measured at cost less accumulat-
ed depreciation and impairment. depreciation is provided 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 
the assets taking into account the expected residual val-
ue. the expected useful lives are assessed to be:
furniture and equipment 3-5 years
it equipment 
 
3-5 years
cost comprises acquisition cost and directly attributable 
costs.
leasehold improvements are capitalised and amortised 
over their estimated useful lives, up to five years, taking 
into account the expected residual value. 
investment assets
investment assets comprise financial assets measured 
at fair value. the classification depends on the purpose 
for which the investments were acquired. management 
determines the classification of its investments on initial 
recognition and re-evaluates this at every reporting date. 
investment assets are measured at fair value on initial and 
subsequent recognition. the determination of fair val-
ue and the classification of value adjustments of finan-
cial instruments in the financial statements depend on

whether the fair value can be reliably measured. generally, 
the group’s financial instruments form part of the trading 
book, however, not unlisted shares and parts of the port-
folio of mortgage deeds designated at fair value.
listed financial assets are measured at fair value based 
on the closing price at the balance sheet date, or, in the 
absence of a closing price, another public price deemed to 
be most similar thereto. 
bonds at amortised cost comprise listed bonds intended 
to be held to maturity and to generate the contractual 
payments over the period. bonds at amortised cost are 
measured at fair value plus transaction costs on initial 
recognition. the bonds are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost.
for the majority of the unlisted shares, it is assessed that 
the fair values can be measured sufficiently reliably using 
recognised valuation methods. these assets are on this 
basis measured at fair value, and value adjustments are 
taken to the income statement. for unlisted assets that 
are managed by external fund managers, these calculate 
an estimated market value based on the estimated pres-
ent value of expected future cash flows.
the measurement of financial instruments at fair value 
is consistent with the group’s internal risk management, 
which is based on market exposure of assets and liabili-
ties subject to risk. 
financial assets are recognised or derecognised at the 
settlement date.
realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from 
changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair 
 value through income are included in the income state-
ment in the period in which they arise.
securities sold under agreements to repurchase at a later 
date (repo transactions) remain in the balance sheet. 
amounts received are included as amounts owed to 
the purchaser and are subject to interest at the agreed 
rate. measurement of securities is unchanged, and both 
value adjustments and interest etc. are recognised in the 
income statement. securities purchased under agree-
ments to resell at a later date (reverse transactions) are 
not recognised in the balance sheet. amounts paid are 
recognised as a receivable and are subject to interest at 
the agreed rate.
derivative financial instruments
derivatives are measured at fair value on initial recog-
nition. subsequently, derivatives are measured at fair 
value at the balance sheet date. changes in fair value are 
recognised in the income statement as financial income or 
expenses.
mortgage deeds
mortgage deeds are measured at fair value on initial and 
subsequent recognition. the calculation of the fair value 
of mortgage deeds is based on both a credit model and a 
market value model including parameters such as expect-
ed prepayments, loss rates and interest rate level. the 
mortgage deed portfolios are valued partly on the basis of 
non-observable input and are therefore to some extent 
subject to estimates. 
the market value model is used for the valuation of mort-
gage deeds not in default. the model builds on a number 
of assumptions for required rate of return, expected credit 
losses and repayments. the model revalues the mortgage 
deed at a value above the nominal amount of the residual 
debt if the mortgage deed coupon is higher than the dis-
count rate less expected credit losses. 
mortgage deeds that meet certain default criteria, includ-
ing delinquency, death of the debtor and forced sale, are 
valued on the basis of the credit model. any unsecured 
part is written down when the default criterion material-
ises. however, in the event of delinquency, the impairment 
writedown will be made over a period of time, always 
provided that any unsecured part must be written down 
to zero after the mortgage deed has been delinquent for a 
period of 180 days. 
balances due from credit institutions
balances due from credit institutions are measured at fair 
value on initial recognition and subsequently at amortised 
cost and comprise all receivables from credit institutions 
and central banks, including receivables in connection with 
genuine purchase and resale transactions.
cash in hand and balances at call
cash in hand and balances at call are measured at fair 
value on initial recognition and subsequently at amortised 
cost. 
contingency funds
the contingency funds can only be used for the benefit of 
policyholders. contingency fund 2 is moreover subject to 
the restriction that it can only be used when permission 
has been obtained from the danish financial supervisory 
authority.
deferred tax has been provided on the group’s contingency 
funds.

dividend
dividends are recognised as a liability in the financial 
statements at the time of adoption by the shareholders at 
the annual general meeting. proposed dividends in respect 
of the financial year are stated as a separate line item in 
the notes relating to shareholders’ equity.
treasury shares
purchases and sales of treasury shares are recognised as 
a change in shareholders’ equity under other reserves.  
share options
the share options are settled by means of treasury shares. 
when the options are exercised, the strike price received 
is taken to equity.
employee shares
alm. brand has established an employee share scheme, 
under which an employee may receive shares in alm. 
brand against a salary reduction. the value of the shares 
is recognised on an ongoing basis as staff costs in the 
income statement. the shares are granted on a quarterly 
basis.
subordinated debt
subordinated debt comprises liabilities which, in the case 
of liquidation or bankruptcy and pursuant to the loan con-
ditions, cannot be settled until any other creditor claims 
have been honoured. subordinated debt is recognised at 
fair value, equalling the payment received less directly 
attributable costs incurred. subsequently, subordinated 
debt is measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
provisions for insurance contracts
all provisions are measured at their discounted value us-
ing a maturity-dependent discount rate including volatility 
adjustment for the duration in question. alm. brand uses 
a yield curve developed in-house according to the same 
principles and on the basis of data identical to the ones 
on which eiopa’s published discount rates is based.
unearned premium provisions
unearned premium provisions comprise the amounts 
provided at the end of the year against claims not yet 
incurred in respect of insurance contracts entered into. 
the provisions are measured as the present value of the 
best estimate of future claims at the balance sheet date 
for the part of the risk period not yet run off, including 
all direct and indirect administrative and claims-handling 
expenses. the premium provisions comprise all insurance 
contracts entered into and take into account all agreed 
premium rates, irrespective of whether they have fallen 
due for payment before the time of calculation. new-
ly written insurance contracts are recognised when an 
agreement has been concluded, whereas renewed insur-
ance contracts are recognised when there is one month or 
less until the renewed contract enters into force. 
unearned premium provisions relating to health and per-
sonal accident insurance are made up according to market 
value principles. they are calculated as the difference 
between the present value of the company’s liabilities in 
respect of health and personal accident policies and the 
present value of the premiums to be paid by policyholders 
in the future using a best estimate of insurance risk and 
costs incurred in managing insurance and claims handling. 
the market value expectations include a risk margin in 
accordance with the solvency ii principles. the insurance 
period for health and personal accident insurances is 
calculated until the next renewal date of the insurance. 
unearned premium provisions will, however, as a minimum 
correspond to an accrual of the premiums collected. 
the provisions are calculated based on an assumption 
of a lower mortality and disability than in the compa-
ny’s calculation basis for new contracts. the reduction is 
estimated based on the company’s historical claims ratios 
on mortality and disability, respectively, and costs rela-
tive to the assumptions in the calculation basis for new 
contracts. the actuary regularly assesses whether the as-
sumptions used to determine the market value calculation 
basis still apply to the company’s portfolio. 
profit margin
profit margin is the expected future earnings for the 
insurance contracts which the company has entered into 
at the end of the year. the profit margin is measured as 
the present value of the accrued profit on profit-making 
contracts.
measurement of the profit margin comprises all insurance 
contracts entered into. newly written insurance con-
tracts in alm. brand forsikring’s portfolio will be recog-
nised when an agreement has been concluded, whereas 
renewed insurance contracts are recognised when there 
is one month or less until the renewed contract enters 
into force. both newly written insurance contracts and 
renewed insurance contracts in the health and personal 
accident insurance portfolio of alm. brand liv og pension 
are recognised as from the beginning of the risk period. 
risk margin
the risk margin comprises the amount which the company 
is expected to have to pay to a third party to take over the 
note 44    accounting policies – continued

annual report 2020

notes
risk that the realised future costs deviate from the esti-
mated level stated under unearned premium and claims 
provisions at the end of the accounting period.
the risk margin is measured as the present value of the 
future cost of capital related to maintaining the solvency 
capital required for settlement of the company’s current 
liabilities and risks.
the measurement is based on the company’s solvency 
capital requirement and is consistent with the solvency ii 
principles, as the future solvency capital requirements are 
approximated by the current solvency capital requirement 
written down proportionally by the remaining share of the 
expected cash flow for the unearned premium and claims 
provisions. the calculation of the cost of capital is based 
on the cost-of-capital rate of 6% under solvency ii. the 
risk margin development tracks the development in the 
company’s solvency capital requirement.
life insurance provisions
life insurance provisions are measured at market value 
based on an expected cash flow discounted using alm. 
brand’s approximation of the maturity-dependent yield 
curve including volatility adjustment published by eiopa. 
the market value expectations include a risk margin in 
accordance with the solvency ii principles. the risk margin 
comprises the amount which the company is expected to 
have to pay to a third party to take over the risk. a profit 
margin is also calculated, which represents the value of 
the future profit which the company is expected to be 
able to recognise as income from its life insurance and 
pension business. the actuary regularly assesses whether 
the assumptions used to determine the market value cal-
culation basis still apply to the company’s portfolio. 
 
the expected future insurance benefits are estimated 
based on projections of mortality, surrender of insurance 
policies and cessation of premiums (paid-up policies). 
these are estimated based on the company’s historical 
claims ratios on mortality and disability, respectively, and 
actual costs relative to the assumptions in the calculation 
basis for new contracts and actual surrenders and premi-
um cessations.
life insurance provisions are divided into provisions for 
guaranteed benefits, individual bonus potential and col-
lective bonus potential. life insurance provisions are cal-
culated at market value, based on individual calculations 
for each policy. also, bonuses earned but not yet added 
to the individual policies are added to the provisions. for 
amounts exempt from tax on pension returns, a discount 
rate without deduction of tax on pension returns is used. 
the provisions are generally calculated based on an as-
sumption of a lower mortality and disability than in the 
company’s calculation basis for new contracts. the reduc-
tion is estimated on the basis of an empirical analysis of 
the company’s insurance portfolio. 
provisions for the guaranteed benefits comprise obli-
gations to pay benefits guaranteed to the policyholder. 
provisions for guaranteed benefits are calculated as the 
difference between the present value of the benefits 
guaranteed by the insurance policy and the present value 
of the expected future insurance administration costs 
less the present value of the agreed future premiums. the 
provision includes an estimated amount in cover of future 
benefits resulting from already incurred claims and an 
estimated amount for claims incurred but not reported.
the individual bonus potential comprises obligations to 
pay a bonus in relation to both expected not yet due 
premiums and premiums already due. the bonus potential 
is calculated as the value of policyholders’ savings less 
provisions for guaranteed benefits, including expectations 
in relation to surrenders and paid-up policies. whether 
the bonus potential is to be strengthened is determined 
individually for each policy. 
outstanding claims provisions
outstanding claims provisions comprise the amounts pro-
vided at the end of the year against claims reported but 
not settled and against payment of claims incurred but 
not reported. the provisions are measured as the present 
value of the best estimate of these claims expenses at the 
balance sheet date. they are generally determined using 
statistical methods based on the aggregate historical de-
velopment in payments and case reserves. the statistical 
methods are supplemented by best estimates of claims 
processors and claims assessors in the event of major 
claims. for workers’ compensation, a separate model has 
been introduced which is mainly based on rulings and 
case officer assessments of individual claims. moreover, 
provisions are made to cover expected delayed report-
ing of claims incurred and expected future reopening of 
claims. in addition to the statistical methods, an assess-
ment is included of other factors affecting the necessary 
level of outstanding claims provisions, such as changes in 
legal practice, internal processes, inflation and singular, 
extreme claims. 
the outstanding claims provisions also include amounts 
to cover direct and indirect costs which are reasona-
bly considered to be adequate in relation to settling the 
claims obligations. the estimate of the provision is based

on the direct and indirect costs incurred during a normal 
claims year on the establishment of new claims and the 
processing and settlement of old claims. included in the 
calculations is the ratio of claims paid and the outstand-
ing claims provisions at year end, including claims in-
curred but not reported.
the cash flow regarding payment of provisions is estimat-
ed for all lines and discounted using alm. brand’s approx-
imation of the maturity-dependent yield curve including 
volatility adjustment published by eiopa.  
for all lines except workers’ compensation, the future 
inflation rate is estimated and recognised implicitly in 
the provisioning models. the future inflation rate forecast 
used in the calculation of provisions in relation to workers’ 
compensation is calculated explicitly and consists of an 
inflation element and a real wage element. 
several assumptions and estimates underlying the calcu-
lation of the provisions for claims are mutually dependent. 
however, the most important interdependence is that 
between the assumption regarding inflation and interest 
rates, although the effect of changes in the inflation rate 
assumption will not affect the calculation of the out-
standing claims provisions as effectively as changes to the 
discount rate.
provisions for claims relating to health and personal 
accident insurance are calculated at the present value of 
expected future payments. the outstanding claims pro-
visions regarding health and personal accident insurance 
also include amounts to cover direct and indirect costs 
which are reasonably considered to be adequate in rela-
tion to settling the claims obligations. for reported claims, 
an individual assessment is made of the date of payment. 
the costs are estimated on the basis of the average dura-
tion of established claims payments and an assessment of 
the annual costs incurred in handling claims. the provi-
sions for current disablement benefits are determined 
individually, and an assessment of the duration of the 
benefits is made for each policy. the provision calculated 
is increased by a risk margin in accordance with the sol-
vency ii principles. 
liability adequacy test
the outstanding claims provisions are calculated accord-
ing to actuarial methods and with a view to avoiding run-
off losses as well as run-off gains. at the calculation date, 
the provisions thus represent the best estimate of future 
claims for the current and previous claims years. the 
outstanding claims provisions are calculated on a monthly 
basis, and the level is therefore assessed to be adequate 
at all times.
the provision will be discounted if such discounting has a 
material impact on the size of the liability.
long-term employee obligations
provisions for pensions and similar obligations com-
prise jubilee benefits etc. to employees, notwithstanding 
that the future benefit is subject to the individual being 
employed by the company at the time of payment of the 
benefit. the value of the future benefits is recognised 
as the present value of the benefits expected to be paid 
based on a best estimate.
current costs in respect of pensions etc. for the group’s 
employees are treated as defined contribution plans. for 
defined contribution plans, the group pays fixed contribu-
tions and has no obligation to pay any further contribu-
tions. the obligations are fully funded.
other financial liabilities 
on initial recognition, other financial liabilities are meas-
ured at fair value less transaction costs. the liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost.
deposits with ceding companies comprise amounts re-
ceived which are kept to cover the insurance liabilities of 
other insurance companies towards the group’s reinsur-
ance companies.
deposits for financial reinsurance comprise premiums 
received less deductions for claims paid equivalent to the 
company’s liabilities pursuant to contracts made.
leasing
on initial recognition, lease liabilities are measured at 
the present value of the lease payments. for discounting, 
the rate implicit in the lease is used, if such rate can be 
readily determined. alternatively, the borrowing rate on 
the company’s overdraft facility at the time of conclu-
sion of the contract is used. subsequently, the liability is 
measured at amortised cost applying the effective interest 
method and recognised in “other liabilities”. remeasure-
ment is effected in the event of a change in the lease 
payments.
payables to credit institutions and central banks
payables to credit institutions and central banks are 
measured at amortised cost and comprise, among other 
things, obligations in connection with genuine sale and 
repurchase transactions with counterparties which are 
credit institutions or central banks and receivable margins 
in connection with futures and option transactions if the 
customer is a credit institution.

segment information
the business segments non-life insurance, life insurance 
and other activities are the group’s primary segments and 
they have been determined on the basis of the regulatory 
differences. no geographical segment information is pro-
vided as the group’s activities are predominantly focused 
on the danish market.
non-life insurance is divided into private and commercial. 
private comprises the group’s insurance sales to private 
households through own sales channels and the group’s 
health and personal accident activities, which for legal 
purposes are placed in alm. brand liv og pension a/s. 
commercial comprises the group’s sales to agricultural 
and commercial customers through own sales channels 
and partnerships. the management reporting related to 
private and commercial consists exclusively of reporting of 
the technical result.
other activities comprise corporate functions consolidated 
in alm. brand a/s and the operation of a debt collection 
and mortgage deed portfolio taken over from alm. brand 
bank.
cash flow statement
the cash flow statement is presented using the direct 
method and shows cash flows from operating, investing 
and financing activities as well as the group’s cash and 
cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the financial 
year.
cash flows from operating activities include the items of 
the income statement adjusted for operating items of a 
non-cash nature. realised gains and losses on the sale of 
tangible assets or investment assets are included in cash 
flows from investing activities.
cash flows from investing activities include changes in 
intra-group accounts and net additions of investment 
assets, including realised gains and losses on the sale of 
such assets.
cash flows from financing activities include financing from 
shareholders as well as by raising of short-term and long-
term loans.
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and demand 
deposits.

financial ratios relating to life insurance have been calculated in accordance with the executive order on financial reporting for insur-
ance companies and multi-employer occupational pension funds. 
alm. brand’s management believes that the use of financial highlight 
and key ratios in the management’s review in respect of each business 
area provides the reader with a good basis for comparing results over 
time. the financial highlights and key ratios have been prepared on the 
basis of the statutory requirements for content and are supplemented 
by individual pieces of relevant information. the information provided 
in the financial highlights and key ratios contain data regularly provided 
to management. the management’s review describes developments in 
the individual business areas based on the financial highlights and key 
ratios. there are only presentation differences between these financial 
highlights and key ratios and “segment reporting, income statement” in 
the ifrs financial statements.
the information provided in the financial highlights and key ratios and 
the management’s review has been supplemented by individual pieces 
of information in addition to what is specified in legislation. the most 
significant information is the following:
payout ratio (alm. brand a/s group):
the total payout ratio for the financial year expresses the total distri-
bution for the year as a percentage of the profit for the year after tax.
underlying combined ratio (non-life insurance):
this ratio is calculated as the combined ratio less factors which may 
vary considerably from year to year (major claims net of reinsurance, 
weather-related claims net of reinsurance and run-off result on claims 
net of reinsurance). accordingly, the underlying combined ratio reflects 
the trend in small claims, costs and reinsurance ceded.
underlying claims ratio (non-life insurance):
the underlying combined ratio less the expense ratio. 
claims experience (non-life insurance):
this figure is calculated as the sum of the claims ratio and the rein-
surance ratio. 
run-off result, claims (non-life insurance):
the run-off result on claims reflects the gains and/or losses relating to 
prior-year technical provisions which affect the result for the current 
year.
run-off result, risk margin (non-life insurance):
the run-off result on the risk margin is to a significant extent offset by 
developments in the risk margin for the current year and is hence more 
or less neutral for the profit for the year.
return requirement for shareholders’ equity (life insurance):
profit before tax broken down according to the guidelines for return on 
equity which the company has reported to the danish financial super-
visory authority.
