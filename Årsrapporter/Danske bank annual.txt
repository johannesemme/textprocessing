letter to our stakeholders
this year, danske bank will celebrate its 150-year 
anniversary, and since the foundation in 1871, it has 
been our role to contribute to economic growth in 
the societies we are part of by enabling families and 
businesses to save and invest and to prepare for the 
opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. 
the covid-19 pandemic was a challenge that few had 
anticipated. it hit without warning and turned lives and 
businesses upside down. 
but as a solid and well-capitalised bank, danske bank 
has been in a good position to support our customers, 
and we have helped reduce economic uncertainty by 
extending credit lines, by helping customers assess 
risks, and by contributing to the maintenance of a well-
functioning fi nancial infrastructure. 
the crisis has reaffi rmed why we are here. we play 
an important role for our customers and for the 
fi nancial infrastructure across the nordic countries. 
we contribute to growth and prosperity, and we act as 
an anchor that creates security and continuity when 
economic cycles turn and crises arise. 
covid-19 continues to be a tremendous challenge. but 
our experience over the past year has demonstrated our 
ability to change and adapt, and it has shown us what 
we can achieve when we all work together to overcome 
such a challenging situation. this bodes well for the 
profound and ambitious transformation we have ahead 
of us. 
in 2019, we announced our ambition to become a 
better bank for customers, employees, society and 
shareholders. in addition to changing the way we work 
and the way we are organised, we are also making 
substantial investments to become a more digital and 
agile bank that has lower costs, fewer and simpler 
products, and better and faster decisionmaking 
processes.  
this will make us more attractive to customers – and 
more competitive. it will also make us a better and more 
engaging place to work, which will help us to recruit 
new talent and retain the good employees we already 
have. collectively, this will enable us to strengthen 
our commercial momentum and to deliver to our 
shareholders better and more sustainable fi nancial 
results in a competitive market with low margins and 
persistently low interest rates. 
over the past year, we have also continued to strengthen 
our risk and compliance setup and have taken active 
measures to address and resolve legacy issues that 
have been both wrong and unacceptable. as we 
continue this work, we are promoting a culture in which 
mistakes are addressed, discussed and resolved in a 
responsible manner. this is the only way we can rebuild 
trust, and it is a key element of our ambition to become a 
better bank that works in the interest of all stakeholders. 
danske bank has evolved over a century and a half as 
a refl ection of the societies we are part of. we have 
helped shape these societies by creating opportunities, 
by helping individuals and businesses to realise their 
ambitions, and by helping to build and innovate the 
fi nancial infrastructure. 
as the largest fi nancial services provider in denmark 
and one of the largest fi nancial institutions in the 
nordic countries, we have a particular responsibility to 
contribute to sustainable growth and development. we 
will fulfi l this responsibility by continuing to evolve in 
tandem with the world around us to run a sustainable 
and profi table business that delivers the solutions that 
our customers and society need.

executive summary
the year 2020 was a challenging year, not only for 
danske bank but for the entire society, fi rst and 
foremost due to the outbreak of the coronavirus 
pandemic. for danske bank more specifi cally, 2020 
marked the year when we turned a corner and in many 
areas made good progress on our efforts to meet our 
2023 ambition of becoming a better bank for all our 
stakeholders.
our agile transformation project called “better ways of 
working” kicked off successfully, and the phrase literally 
got a second meaning as the pandemic signifi cantly 
changed the way in which we work with our customers 
and other stakeholders. from the middle of march, we 
transformed our daily work into a “working from home 
set-up” backed by virtual communication channels and 
stable it systems.
as a result, our dedicated employees made a 
tremendous effort to help our customers counter the 
disruption of their fi nancial situation and business 
caused by the pandemic. our support covered a wide 
range of different initiatives, from dedicated advisory 
services on a one-on-one customer basis to extending 
credit lines and providing liquidity facilities.
in a year that to a large extent was dominated by the 
corona crisis, the nordic economies held up relatively 
well and our underlying business was stable, with 
growth coming from banking nordic and large corporate 
customers. visibility regarding the global economic 
recovery is still limited however, and many uncertainties 
remain. due to the pandemic, the countercyclical buffer 
requirement in denmark was released in march with 
the aim of increasing the lending capacity throughout 
the sector and support the society. with strong capital 
and liquidity positions, danske bank continues to be well 
prepared to face these uncertainties and to continue to 
support our customers.
danske bank posted a net profi t of dkk 4.6 billion 
for 2020, against dkk 15.1 billion in the year before, 
which, however, included signifi cant net positive non-
recurring items. the return on shareholders’ equity 
in 2020 was 2.6%, against 9.6% in 2019. the net 
profi t in 2020 was affected mainly by loan impairment 
charges of dkk 7 billion, refl ecting expected credit 
losses due to the corona crisis.
total income in 2020 was stable, excluding one-off 
effects. net interest income in 2020 refl ected the 
steady progress in our business and was stable from 
the level in 2019, despite a challenging business 
environment. net fee income and net trading income 
maintained the good momentum from last year, despite 
signifi cantly lower remortgaging activity and diffi cult 
conditions in the fi nancial markets in the beginning of 
the year. given an environment with continually negative 
interest rates, the pricing of deposits was adjusted 
accordingly, also for retail deposits with effect from 
january 2021.
costs were in line with our expectations. we are 
seeing the effect of our cost management initiatives, 
and underlying costs were lower in the latter half of 
2020. reported costs, however, came in higher than in 
2019 as a result of planned costs for the better bank 
transformation as well as costs for ongoing compliance 
remediation and the estonia case. in addition, an 
extraordinary write-down of intangible assets was 
made as a result of redesigning the organisation, and a 
provision was made for part of the transformation costs 
for 2021.
as a result of the continued execution of our 2023 plan 
to become a more effi cient bank, we took additional cost 
initiatives. including the initiatives announced at the end 
of january 2021, tangible progress has been made, 
as we have now discontinued approximately 700 out 
of the up to 1,600 positions that will be discontinued 
as announced in october 2020. part of the reduction 
was achieved through layoffs, voluntary redundancy 
agreements and natural attrition. reducing the cost 
base further is a key part of our 2023 plan to become a 
better bank and to make sure that we can continue to be 
competitive in a low-rate and low-margin environment.
credit quality remained overall strong, and the high 
level of expected credit losses mainly refl ects two 
things. firstly, the signifi cant impairment charges in the 
fi rst quarter relating to changes in the forward-looking 
macroeconomic scenarios driven by the corona crisis. 
most of these were later released as key economic 
indicators performed better than expected. we have, 
however, countered these model-driven releases with 
sector-specifi c post-model adjustments of dkk 2.7 
billion, as we continue our cautious approach to risks 
danske bank / annual report 2020
08
and visibility is limited. secondly, we have booked 
charges against oil-related exposures of dkk 3.3 
billion. so far, the need for charges against corona 
crisis-sensitive sectors has been fairly limited due to 
government support programmes and our balanced 
portfolio.
better bank update
in 2020, we laid the foundation for our journey towards 
becoming a better bank for all our stakeholders. while 
this work will continue in the coming years towards 
meeting our 2023 ambitions, we have made tangible 
progress in many areas in 2020.
we announced changes to the organisation and to 
the executive leadership team (elt). the aim of the 
redesigned organisation is to reduce complexity, 
increase effi ciency and become even more competitive 
for our customers. from 1 january 2021, our 
commercial activities are organised in two business 
units, personal & business customers headed by glenn 
söderholm and large corporates & institutions headed 
by berit behring. we also announced a new commercial 
leadership team (clt), comprising 12 senior leaders 
from across the business in addition to the elt, to 
increase our execution power as one bank and achieve a 
faster time to market.
we started an agile transformation project to change 
the way in which we work at danske bank, called ‘better 
ways of working’. the aim is to enable us to respond 
better and faster to customers’ changing expectations, 
to ensure a better and more digital customer experience 
as well as to bring down costs. the changes will directly 
affect more than 4,000 employees across danske bank.
we accelerated the simplifi cation of the product offering 
across the group in order to reduce risk and complexity 
– making it easier to be a customer at danske bank.
we continued to make progress on digitalising our know-
your-customer and ongoing due diligence processes in 
order to increase effi ciency and improve the customer 
experience.
we have seen strong progress on sustainable fi nance, 
with green loans and bonds reaching a volume of 
dkk 102 billion and green investments a volume of 
dkk 27 billion. furthermore, we have supported more 
than 5,000 start-ups and scale-ups as a part of our 
contribution to the sustainable development of society.
we strengthened our frameworks across anti-money 
laundering and investor protection and improved our 
compliance capabilities, as a robust compliance culture 
is the foundation for fi ghting fi nancial crime and ensuring 
that we always have the best interest of our customers 
in mind. furthermore, we are investing heavily into both 
execution of compliance remediation and additional 
dedicated initiatives to build the required capabilities and 
processes for future good conduct outcomes.  
danske bank is undertaking a multi-year enhancement 
to its aml controls which are set out in a 
comprehensive fi nancial crime plan. the bank has 
made signifi cant progress and we continue to improve 
our fi nancial crime framework in close dialogue with 
the danish fsa. in this context, the bank has received 
a draft decision from the danish fsa indicating that it 
intends to appoint one or more independent expert(s) 
to assist the danish fsa in its ongoing supervisory 
activities related to the execution of the bank’s fi nancial 
crime plan. the bank is expecting a fi nal decision from 
the danish fsa in the near future.
estonia and remediation matters 
the internal investigation work that danske bank had 
planned to complete during 2020 has been fi nalised and 
danske bank has reported the fi ndings to the relevant 
authorities investigating danske bank. we continue 
to fully cooperate and will provide the authorities 
with further information if and when requested. the 
overall timing of the authorities’ investigations remains 
unknown and is not within danske bank’s control.  
in december 2020, dansk bank was informed by the 
u.s. department of treasury’s offi ce of foreign assets 
control that it had decided to close its investigation of 
danske bank in relation to the estonia case with no 
action.
in addition to the estonia case, during 2020, we handled 
various legacy remediation issues such as flexinvest fri 
and the debt collection case in denmark. a new central 
unit has been established with the task of overseeing 
the remediation of the identifi ed legacy issues and 
ensuring a fully transparent approach along with timely 
communication with customers and other stakeholders.
dividend
due to the corona crisis, it was decided, as was the case 
also for other european banks, not to pay dividends for 
2019, but to add the proposed dividend amount back 
danske bank / annual report 2020
09
to further bolster our already strong capital base. this 
decision was made to support the initiatives and the 
recommendations from the government and the danish 
fsa aimed at minimising the economic consequences of 
the pandemic.
for 2020 we propose a dividend of dkk 2 per 
share, which is slightly below the payout ratio set 
by our general dividend policy. this is in line with the 
recommendations issued by the danish fsa for capital 
preservation due to the uncertainty associated with the 
corona crisis. 
our dividend policy, which states our ambition to pay out 
40-60% of net profi t, remains unchanged.
outlook for 2021
the outlook has been aligned with the new presentation 
of earnings from danica pension, which going forward 
will be presented as net income from insurance 
business. we refer to page 36 for a further description 
and presentation of the changes. 
we expect net profi t for 2021 to be in the range of 
dkk 9-11 billion. 
we expect total income to be slightly higher than the 
level in 2020, subject mainly to commercial momentum 
and broader economic developments. 
expenses are expected to be no more than dkk 24.5 
billion, driven by ongoing cost initiatives and lower costs 
for transformation and remediation. 
loan impairments are expected to be no more than 
dkk 3.5 billion, subject to a modest macroeconomic 
recovery based on a positive impact from covid-19 
vaccines.
we maintain our ambition for a return on shareholders’ 
equity of 9-10% in 2023.
the outlook is subject to uncertainty and depends on 
economic conditions, including government support 
packages.

introduction
at the end of last year, we launched the better bank 
transformation and announced clear ambitions towards 
2023 for all our stakeholder groups: customers, 
employees, society and shareholders. we started 
our multi-year transformation to become a simpler 
and more competitive bank, to continue our journey 
towards becoming more integrated into the lives of 
our customers and the nordic societies as well as to 
address a number of industry- and danske bank-specifi c 
challenges. 
one year into our transformation, we are satisfi ed with 
progress and traction, although 2020 was a year with 
challenges that affected both the industry as a whole 
and danske bank specifi cally. the year 2020 was a 
busy period for the group, as we served and supported 
our customers during the corona crisis while continuing 
our commitment to handling various remediation 
matters such as the estonia case, flexinvest fri and, 
most recently, the debt collection case in denmark.
despite these infl uences, we are well on track with our 
transformation and already in 2020, we took several 
signifi cant steps towards becoming a better bank.
we spent about dkk 1.7 billion in transformation 
initiatives to lay the foundation for delivering on our four 
ambitions towards key stakeholders by 2023. most of 
our transformation costs were linked to four focus areas, 
which are critical contributors in terms of fulfi lling our 
2023 ambitions:
• 
 better ways of working: we have transformed our 
entire development organisation to work agilely, 
thus creating the foundation for a step change 
towards a more scalable, digital and better customer 
experience going forward
• 
 purpose, brand, culture & engagement: we have 
engaged our employees and leadership across the 
organisation to defi ne a new internal culture that we 
aspire to and a purpose to act as our “north star”
• 
 costs: during the year, we achieved a decrease 
in our underlying cost base and have a clear path 
towards becoming a simpler and more effi cient bank 
in the future, and we expect lower costs already in 
2021
• 
 compliance under control: we are establishing 
an effective and effi cient compliance function and 
implementing enhancements in core areas such 
as conduct, trade surveillance and transaction 
monitoring
even though we are only one year into our 
transformation, we can already see the fi rst tangible 
deliveries towards our 2023 ambitions for each of our 
key stakeholder groups:
customers 
customers are the reason why we exist and we strive 
to deliver the best customer experience. we want to 
provide our customers with reliable, proactive and 
relevant ﬁ nancial advice that helps them become 
ﬁ nancially conﬁ dent in the channel of their choice and at 
any time. 
we are currently on the right path towards achieving 
our 2023 ambition in relation to customers. while 
we are not yet meeting our target on average to be 
among the top two in customer satisfaction and have 
some way to go, we are on target for example for 
commercial customers at banking dk, banking nordic 
and corporates & institutions due to the strength of our 
product offering, high proactivity, and strict focus on 
customer needs.

to become even more customer-centric, we have 
developed our service models further over the course of 
the last year and will continue on this path in 2021. as 
an outcome, retail customers in both denmark and the 
other nordic countries as well as mid-corp customers 
stand to benefi t from improved advisory services 
whenever and wherever they want to meet us.
we have further developed and launched new products 
and tools throughout the year that enable us to provide 
additional services to our customers. a majority of the 
products launched targets solving customer needs while 
also supporting a transition into a sustainable future.
 employees 
our employees are our main asset, and we aspire to 
have engaged employees who are proud to work at 
danske bank. further, we want a skilled and motivated 
workforce and a strong talent pool to ensure that we 
continue to meet increasing customer expectations.
to pave the way for improving our employee 
engagement, in 2020, we explored the expectations 
of our customers, colleagues and other stakeholders 
through roundtables, surveys and other activities to 
support us in identifying and shaping a new purpose and 
cultural commitments. this will be integrated into the 
organisation as part of our purpose, brand, culture and 
engagement initiative in early 2021.
in addition, during the corona crisis we managed to 
enable almost our entire workforce to work remotely 
from home within a few weeks, so that our customers 
continued to receive the services and advice they 
needed while minimising the risk of infection among our 
customers and employees in accordance with the health 
and safety guidelines issued by the authorities. we will 
continue on this path and give our employees much 
more fl exibility in their work life, for example by working 
from home, with “working@danske”.
as part of having a more open, diverse and inclusive 
culture, we have a dedicated focus on increasing the 
diversity of our staff with specifi c initiatives, such as 
a new policy giving rainbow families equal rights to 
parental leave, and have taken several other initiatives 
to further support diversity in the hiring and internal 
promotion processes.
in order to benefi t from the contribution each individual 
at danske bank can make, we also further increased the 
autonomy of our employees at work. as an example, the 
entire agile transformation will lead to more personal 
fl exibility and development in our daily work, closely 
embedded in teams working cross-functionally and 
moving closer to our customers, which will also further 
drive employee engagement.
they include new mortgage products in denmark, where 
we launched a flexlife® loan type with a fi xed rate of 
interest for 30 years. in order to further promote the 
sustainability agenda, we continued to give customers 
a broader range of choices. for example, we launched 
danica balance sustainable choice and danske invest 
global sustainable future.
throughout the year, we improved our digital solutions 
for our customers, which led to danske bank being 
awarded international prizes for best use of mobile and 
as digital financial institution of the year in denmark. 
during the corona crisis, we increased digital interaction 
with our customers signifi cantly. for example, most cust-
omer meetings were held digitally during the lockdown, 
and we will continue to develop our digital platforms 
such as danske mobile banking and district in the years 
to come, further leveraging recent learnings to meet the 
changing expectations of our customers.
moreover, we deepened our collaboration with partners 
to create value for our customers. our cooperation with 
axeptia is one example of this. the joint offering went 
live in 2020 and gives us a unique position among 
competitors. we can provide axeptia’s credit manage-
ment solution to business customers, enabling them to 
optimise their liquidity and cash fl ow. after initially going 
to market in norway, we are scaling the offering across 
the nordic countries.
we also launched a new commercial organisation with a 
commercial leadership team, which will drive the com-
mercial agenda, and introduced two new chief customer 
offi cers to ensure our customers have an even stronger 
voice in our organisation.
12
danske bank / annual report 2020
 society 
we are an integral part of our customers’ lives, and at 
the core of our societal ambition is our desire to act in 
the best interest of our customers. this includes open 
and transparent communication while supporting our 
customers’ transformation and the societies that we are 
part of in becoming sustainable.
we have made signifi cant progress on our sustainability 
agenda, which we launched in early 2020 with seven 
dedicated targets towards 2023. already now, we are 
well ahead of our expectations in some areas. in the 
area of sustainable investing, for instance, we have 
already reached more than two thirds of our ambition of 
dkk 30 billion in green investments in danica pension 
by 2023, with current green investments totalling in 
excess of dkk 20 billion. in relation to sustainable 
fi nancing, early results are even more promising. here, 
the volume of green loans and bonds has surpassed 
dkk 100 billion, against a target of well above dkk 100 
billion in sustainable fi nancing, including arranged bonds, 
by 2023. hence, both targets will be revised during 
2021. furthermore, we continue to deliver on our long-
term commitment to help the societies we are a part of 
to prosper, for example by fostering entrepreneurship. 
our digital platform the hub is a key channel through 
which we realise our target of supporting 10,000 start-
ups and scale-ups by 2023. created fi ve years ago, 
the platform provides access to investors, a recruiting 
channel, and growth and impact expertise and tools 
across the nordic countries. the signifi cant milestones 
of 500,000 job applications and more than 25,000 
jobs posted through the platform recently reached are 
testament to its success.
one of our important contributions to society is to 
provide equal opportunities. hence, we have taken 
several steps on diversity & inclusion (d&i) such 
as appointing d&i leads across the organisation, 
updating our d&i policy, launching an internal education 
programme for managers, and commencing new 
initiatives on inclusion, equal opportunities and creating 
an attractive workplace.
a robust compliance culture is the foundation for 
fi ghting fi nancial crime and meeting our regulatory 
compliance obligations, ensuring that we always 
have the best interest of our customers in mind. we 
have strengthened our frameworks across aml and 
investor protection and have improved our compliance 
capabilities after making it a focus area of the better 
bank transformation in 2020. further, we are investing 
heavily into both execution of our aml remediation 
and four additional better bank initiatives dedicated 
to building the capabilities and processes required 
to further improve compliance. it is essential that 
we deliver on our aml remediation to safeguard the 
fi nancial system. over the course of the past year, 
we have completed odd on more than 2.5 million 
customers across danske bank, a substantial portion of 
which was completed by harnessing automation. 
you can read more about our efforts in relation 
to sustainability throughout this report and in the 
sustainability report 2020.
 
shareholders
in 2023, we have an ambition to achieve a return on 
shareholders’ equity of 9-10%, as we will continuously 
improve our proﬁ tability level by leveraging our full 
potential.
the year 2020 was a year of investment in our future 
fi nancial performance on the basis of the better bank 
transformation. as a result, we have progressed 
considerably towards creating the foundation for 
regaining commercial momentum. examples include 
adopting more agile ways of working and creating end-
to-end responsibilities for customer value propositions, 
commencing the accelerated digitisation of the journeys 
most relevant for our customers and advancing 
towards more scalable and standardised processes and 
operating models in our retail and mid-corp segments 
across the nordic countries.
but while we are expecting to reap the benefi ts of these 
changes going forward, the past year was overshadowed 
by the global corona crisis. it caused considerable 
headwinds for our income, as retail and commercial 
customers in the nordic societies together with the rest 
of the world felt the impact of lockdowns and heightened 
uncertainty throughout the year. this increased 
impairment levels, particularly in sectors signifi cantly 
13
danske bank / annual report 2020
affected by the lockdowns, either directly or indirectly. 
since summer, we have witnessed encouraging signs 
for the recovery of our business lines across the 
board, exemplifi ed by increased customer activity and 
rebounding trading income in corporates & institutions. 
however, despite the commencement of vaccination 
programmes, tightened restrictions introduced across 
our markets as recently as january and the extension 
of monetary and fi scal support packages that are yet 
to cease underpin the great uncertainty as to how the 
global pandemic will continue to affect our business.
in addition, we used 2020 to invest in and pave the way 
for further improvement of cost levels. through intensive 
efforts, we will manage to follow a strong trajectory 
of enhanced cost levels until 2023 – with the fi rst 
milestone to be reached in 2021, when we expect total 
costs to amount to around dkk 24.5 billion.
a long-term structural decrease of our cost base will 
be enabled by two key changes implemented over the 
course of the past year. firstly, our agile transformation 
will allow us to accelerate the digitalisation of key 
processes in coming months. secondly, we launched 
a new and simplifi ed commercial organisation in 
january 2021 and will serve our customers from two 
business units going forward: personal & business 
customers, and large corporates & institutions. the 
rethinking of our organisation allows us not only to 
remove unnecessary complexity, but also to bundle our 
commercial competencies to better support different 
customer groups in the best possible way and further 
enhance our business activity.
further simplifi cation will drive our operational 
performance. we continued to improve operational 
effectiveness in customer-facing and back-offi ce 
processes. for example, while introducing new relevant 
products, we are also simplifying our product offering 
and in 2020 reduced the number of products by 25% at 
banking dk and banking nordic and by more than 50% 
at corporates & institutions. further, we are improving 
and modernising our it infrastructure, leading to a 
signifi cant reduction in developer waiting time.
   road ahead for 2021
we will proceed on our journey to become a better 
bank and will deliver on our ambitious agenda for all 
our stakeholders. in 2021, we will continue to drive our 
transformation and at an increasing pace see results 
made possible by investments made in 2020 and 
the new business unit structure from the beginning of 
2021.
we expect that our customers will benefi t from the 
digitalisation of key customer journeys and easier 
access to banking products and services. employees 
in development functions will experience new ways of 
working because the agile transformation will increase 
employee empowerment and give a greater end-to-
end responsibility. improving our compliance further 
will mark an important next step in our commitment to 
society and the protection of the integrity of fi nancial 
markets. and fi nally, we will drive the process of 
regaining commercial momentum by, for example, 
leveraging new digital enablers and launching customer 
service models and value propositions while continuing 
to execute diligently on our cost roadmap to improve 
profi tability.

the creation of societal value and business value can 
and must go hand in hand. this assumption drives our 
approach to sustainability and is an important lever for 
our better bank plan and the transformation we want 
to accomplish towards 2023. while 2020 in many 
ways was a challenging year, the corona crisis has also 
reinforced the importance of sustainable development, 
and we will look to support our customers and society at 
large in ‘building back better’. 
sustainability strategy towards 2023
the 17 un sustainable development goals (sdgs) and 
society’s sustainability transition towards 2030 continue 
to drive rapid change across markets. for the fi nancial 
sector in particular, the eu action plan on sustainable 
finance, the task force on climate-related financial 
disclosures (tcfd), the principles for responsible 
banking (prb) and the principles for responsible 
investments (pri), all of which are supported by danske 
bank, are shaping market developments and our 
business signifi cantly. 
in 2020, we revisited our sustainability strategy to refl ect 
both external and internal developments and to meet our 
stakeholders’ expectations to capture the increasing risks 
and opportunities. our updated sustainability strategy 
builds on our foundation, on results achieved in recent 
years and on our better bank 2023 ambitions, thereby 
further developing the areas that create both societal 
value and business value. this will also strengthen 
danske bank’s competitiveness.
the strategy has sustainable fi nance at its core and 
refl ects our ambition to take a leading position on 
sustainable fi nance in the nordic countries by 2023. 
the strategy includes fi ve additional focus areas, which 
are of high importance for our stakeholders and are 
vital to our performance and credibility on the overall 
sustainability agenda.

with our updated strategy and associated 2023 
targets, we aim to contribute to the un’s 2030 agenda 
for sustainable development and the sdgs. in the past 
couple of years, we have targeted our efforts on sdg 4: 
quality education, sdg 8: decent work and economic 
growth, and sdg 13: climate action. refl ecting our 
work to promote equal opportunities in leadership and 
our efforts to reduce illicit fi nancial fl ows and combat 
fi nancial crime, the updated strategy also addresses 
sdg 5: gender equality and sdg 16: peace, justice and 
strong institutions.
through our sustainable fi nance offerings, we potentially 
have an indirect impact on all 17 sdgs. depending 
on the underlying activities, the impact can be both 
negative and positive, which we will start mapping in 
more detail in 2021 in line with our prb commitment. 
we monitor progress against our 2023 targets, and in 
2020, we started to integrate environmental, social and 
governance (esg) related kpis into our performance 
management framework. we have so far included three 
kpis on environmental footprint, employee well-being
& diversity and governance & integrity in the group’s 
variable remuneration structure to ensure that all 
employees’ variable remuneration is clearly linked to our 
ambitions in these areas.

our group sustainability strategy cuts across the entire 
business, and the majority of employees working with 
sustainability are fi rmly rooted in our business units. to 
further support coordination and to accelerate group-
wide execution, we in 2020 established a sustainable 
finance council and a diversity & inclusion council, both 
of which include representatives from all business units 
and from relevant group functions.
sustainable ﬁ nance 
we defi ne sustainable fi nance as “fi nance to support 
economic growth while reducing negative impacts and 
increasing positive impacts on esg factors”. this aligns 
well with the eu’s defi nition, and it includes integration of 
esg considerations, which we are continuously working 
to improve, into our fi nancing and investing activities 
across the group.
sustainable fi nancing is the provision of loans and bonds 
for projects and activities that have a clearly defi ned 
environmental or social benefi t. we issue our own green 
bonds to fi nance our green lending activities, and we 
arrange sustainable bond issues for our customers to 
support the fi nancing of their sustainable transition. the 
overwhelming growth and interest in green loans felt 
by both danske bank and realkredit danmark on the 
back of our green bond issues, as well as the interest in 
arranged sustainable bonds for customers, continued 
in 2020 and led to the provision of dkk 102 billion in 
sustainable fi nancing by the group. this surpasses our 
2023 target of dkk 100 billion set in 2019. we will 
review our sustainable fi nancing ambitions in 2021.
responsible investing is a cornerstone of our fi duciary 
duty to protect and grow our customers’ investments 
and ambition to create value for society. we integrate 
esg factors into our investment processes, products 
and advisory services and we exercise active ownership 
and apply screenings and restrictions as part of our 
work. in 2019, danica pension communicated our 
green investment pledge of dkk 100 billion by 2030. 
in 2020, danica pension increased its investments in 
the green transition by 164% – from dkk 10.3 billion 
to dkk 27.2 billion. the current volume of investments 
means danica pension is close to reaching its initial 
2023 milestone of dkk 30 billion, and we will review 
our investment milestones in 2021.
in addition to our volume targets on fi nancing and 
investing, we also work to align our corporate loan 
portfolio and danica pension’s investment portfolio 
to the objectives of the paris agreement on climate 
change. to support our work, we in 2020 joined the 
partnership for carbon accounting financials (pcaf), 
which aims to develop and implement a harmonised 
approach to measuring and disclosing greenhouse gas 
(ghg) emissions associated with loans and investments 
based on the ghg protocol. we also pledged to make 
danica pension’s investment portfolio carbon-neutral by 
2050 when we joined the global un-convened net-zero 
asset owner alliance in 2020. 
in december 2020, we launched our sustainable 
fi nance framework to provide guidance on the 
implementation of our ambition and targets, while also 
identifying key focus areas for execution and potential 
synergies. towards 2023, we will further develop our 
position across customer segments and sectors.
tcfd reporting 
– climate-related risks and opportunities  
in our sustainability report 2020, we report 
on the tcfd in relation to governance, strategy, 
risk management, and metrics and targets. our 
tcfd execution relies on embedding climate 
considerations into business units’ operations while 
collaborating across our organisation to share and 
develop best practices. we aim to continuously 
improve in developing the required tools, methods 
and practices for full tcfd implementation. in 
2020, embedding all the necessary climate data for 
suffi cient climate risks and opportunity disclosures 
has been a key focus area and will continue to be 
a priority in the coming years. also, we actively 
participate in industry-wide collaboration to enhance 
our own and the fi nancial industry’s expertise. we 
had an active role in unepfi’s tcfd pilot phase 
ii, and we will continue onto phase iii in 2021, 
when we also look to disclose more quantitative 
information about the group’s climate-related risks 
and opportunities.
danske bank / annual report 2020
18
entrepreneurship 
when we support the growth of new businesses that 
can drive innovation and job creation, we contribute 
to the overall well-being and sustainable development 
of society. since 2016, we have supported 5,065 
start-ups and scale-ups with growth and impact tools, 
services and expertise. the hub, danske bank’s free, 
digital community platform, has been a key initiative in 
our efforts to address the main scalability challenges 
that growth companies face, such as recruitment and 
access to capital. 
financial conﬁ dence 
to contribute to people’s fi nancial confi dence, we help 
children and young people to develop sound money 
habits and to progress all the way to a fi nancially secure 
adulthood. since early 2018, we have supported more 
than one million children, young people and parents with 
fi nancial literacy tools and expertise. to reach our 2023 
target, we will scale up our initiatives and evolve our 
fi nancial literacy programmes to refl ect the digitalisation 
of money and developments in society and technology.
governance & integrity 
setting the foundation and being clear on expectations 
for individual behaviour across our group is important 
for building and maintaining a strong culture that 
embeds compliance into everything we do. our code 
of conduct policy identifi es the principles we seek to 
uphold and the associated areas that underpin wider 
rules and standards across policies, processes and risk 
management. 95% of our employees completed and 
passed risk and compliance training on time in 2020, 
and as regulatory requirements continue to evolve, we 
continue to invest in developing our risk management 
framework and capabilities to ensure that expectations 
remain fi rmly embedded in our daily activities.
in recent years, we have invested substantially in 
enhancing our procedures, systems and competencies 
to prevent money laundering and other fi nancial crime 
risks. despite coronavirus-related challenges, 2020 
was a year in which we made solid transformational 
progress towards strengthening our defences. part of 
our employee training on fi nancial crime prevention 
includes understanding tax affairs at customer level and 
detecting tax evasion. we have a fi rm position on tax 
compliance, and we do not participate in abusive tax 
arrangements. 
furthermore, we introduced an anti-bribery and 
corruption policy in late 2020, which in 2021 will be 
complemented by a separate instruction that includes 
a set of criteria for sponsorship agreements. this will 
improve our assessment of anti-corruption risks and 
controls across the group. in 2020, we updated our 
gifts and hospitality instruction and broadened the 
scope, criteria and principles for providing and receiving 
gifts and hospitality.
adding to this, we in 2020 updated our escalation 
policy to give additional clarity to employees on how 
to recognise and properly raise issues of concern, 
thereby enabling us to respond faster and more 
effectively. employees can also report concerns about 
irregularities or wrongdoings anonymously through 
our whistleblowing scheme, which also applies to 
external stakeholders. in 2020, we redesigned the 
whistleblowing reporting site to make it more inviting, 
user-friendly and to provide a strong sense of trust 
and security, and we further developed our training on 
whistleblowing. the number of whistleblowing reports 
increased by more than 50% from 2019 to 2020.
we also work closely with partners and suppliers to 
promote responsible business conduct throughout our 
supply chain. our responsible sourcing process is part 
of our supplier due diligence programme alongside other 
supplier assessments, such as it security, fi nancial 
assessment and gdpr.
employee well-being & diversity 
to become a more engaging workplace, we seek 
better ways of working, a sense of belonging and equal 
opportunities for all our employees, and we foster well-
being among our employees, and build a diverse and 
inclusive culture that mirrors the societies we are part 
of. we recognise gender diversity as a driving force 
for other diversity aspects, and we aim to increase the 
share of women in senior leadership positions from 28% 
in 2020 to 35% in 2023. measures include targeted 
recruitment where there is always at least one woman in 
the fi nal fi eld of candidates for leadership positions and 
on the hiring committee.
danske bank / annual report 2020

in a short period of time, the coronavirus pandemic 
drastically changed our ways of working. also, the 
execution of our better bank plan with increased focus 
on cost and more effective ways of working led to 
layoffs. both of these factors have had a negative effect 
on employee engagement, and reversing this trend is a 
strong ambition for us.
in a survey conducted among our employees in 2020, 
working from home was seen as an important measure 
for improving mental health, because it increased 
engagement, made life less stressful and decreased 
common illnesses. on this basis, we in june introduced 
our working from home initiative, which allows 
employees across the group to work from home one 
to two days a week, subject to agreement with their 
manager. our expert team on mental health and well-
being and our close to 500 mental health ambassadors 
also played a vital role in promoting initiatives that 
build mental resilience and elevate the well-being of 
our employees. we introduced a new intranet site that 
provides inspiration, tools and training for management 
and employees on how to cope with change and 
uncertainties – in both a professional and a private 
context.
environmental footprint 
efforts to minimise our own environmental footprint 
focus on reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases 
from our premises, operations and travel. key initiatives 
include more digital meetings, energy-effi cient buildings, 
environmentally friendly company cars and a reduction 
in air travel. in 2020, our operations resulted in 7,871 
tonnes of co2 emissions, which is a 48% decrease 
from 2019 and an 86% decrease from 2010. because 
this signifi cant drop in co2 emissions was mainly a 
result of the coronavirus pandemic, our current 2023 
target will be retained without change. 
more information 
we have continued to integrate esg considerations into 
our risk management framework, which is covered in 
our risk management report 2020.
in terms of esg ratings, these cover a range of analytical 
activities that address a business’s societal impact. 
danske bank has chosen to focus on dialogue with 
six providers, who are selected on the basis of their 
importance to our investors. this is described further in 
the capital and liquidity management section on p. 30.
altogether, our independently assured sustainability 
report 2020 serves as our communication on progress 
to the un global compact, it meets proposal 14, cf. 
the 25 proposals by finance denmark’s anti-money 
laundering task force, and ensures compliance with 
sections 135a and b of the danish fsa’s executive 
order on financial reports for credit institutions 
and investment firms etc. the report is available 
at danskebank.com/sustainability. the report is 
supplemented by our sustainability fact book 2020, 
which also includes our prb reporting obligation.

in 2020, danske bank continued the handling of a 
number of remediation matters, including the estonia 
case, the flexinvest fri case and, most recently, the debt 
collection case in denmark.
estonia case
investigation
danske bank continues to cooperate with various 
authorities regarding the terminated non-resident 
portfolio at danske bank’s branch in estonia. this 
includes criminal and regulatory investigations by 
authorities in estonia, denmark, france and the united 
states.
danske bank reports to, responds to and cooperates 
with various authorities, including the danish state 
prosecutor for serious economic and international 
crime (“sØik”), the u.s. department of justice (doj) 
and the u.s. securities and exchange commission 
(sec), in relation to the estonia case.
the internal investigation work planned for completion in 
2020 has been fi nalised and danske bank has reported 
the fi ndings to the relevant authorities investigating 
danske bank. the bank continues to fully cooperate and 
will provide the authorities with further information if and 
when requested. 
the completion and the outcome of the investigations 
by and subsequent discussions with the authorities 
are uncertain. it is not yet possible to reliably estimate 
the timing, form of resolution, or amount of potential 
settlement or fi nes, which could be material.
in december 2020, danske bank was informed by 
the u.s. department of treasury’s offi ce of foreign 
assets control (“ofac”) that it had decided to close 
its investigation of danske bank in relation to the 
estonia case with no action. ofac is the u.s. authority 
responsible for civil enforcement of u.s. sanctions.
civil claims
danske bank is also subject to ongoing litigation in 
relation to the estonia case. this includes, inter alia, an 
action fi led against danske bank in the united states 
district court for the southern district of new york 
(which was initially dismissed but has been appealed) 
and a number of court cases initiated against danske 
bank in denmark. danske bank intends to defend itself 
against the various claims. the timing of completion 
of any such lawsuits (pending or threatening) and their 
outcome are uncertain and could be material.
flexinvest fri case
in november 2020, danske bank accepted a fi ne 
of dkk 9 million from sØik for violating the danish 
executive order on investor protection in connection 
with the flexinvest fri case.
all affected customers have been contacted, and we 
have compensated more than 99%. we have taken 
several initiatives to handle the issue and make sure 
something similar should not happen again.
market monitoring
in 2019, the danish fsa conducted an inspection of 
danske bank’s market monitoring function and issued 
a number of orders on 6 december 2019. danske 
bank has since then taken a series of steps to ensure 
compliance with the orders. in addition, the danish fsa 
also announced further investigation, which in june 
2020 led the danish fsa to fi le a criminal complaint 
against danske bank a/s for violation of the market 
abuse regulation on account of inadequate market 
monitoring and market manipulation in respect of 
opposite trades. danske bank has a dialogue with and 
cooperates with sØik, but cannot comment further on 
the criminal complaint as long as sØik is investigating 
the case.
debt collection case
in our efforts to become a better bank, we have in recent 
years systematically improved compliance, risk and 
control capabilities and processes and sought to foster 
a management culture under which potential issues are 
raised and addressed.
in connection with this work, several issues have been 
identifi ed. these include the debt collection issue, which 
we have worked on remediating since 2019, including 
by providing information to the authorities and initiating 
communication to customers in june 2020.
estonia and remediation matters 
danske bank / annual report 2020
21
on 21 september 2020, the danish fsa issued four 
orders to danske bank in relation to the systemic 
errors in our debt collection system and the ongoing 
remediation. on 20 october 2020, danske bank 
confi rmed to the danish fsa that it would comply with 
the orders.
on 26 november 2020, the danish fsa ordered 
danske bank to arrange for and bear the costs of an 
impartial investigation into the measures taken and to be 
taken by danske bank to correct the errors in the debt 
collection process and into the it systems used for debt 
collection.
we welcome the impartial investigation, and will 
continue the cooperation with the danish fsa.
danske bank remains committed to contacting and 
compensating all affected customers.
other legacy issues
as communicated on 22 october 2020, we have 
identifi ed a number of other legacy issues. to accelerate 
and strengthen the remediation efforts and to ensure 
consistent and timely remediation of these issues, a 
new central unit has been established with the task 
of overseeing the remediation of the identifi ed legacy 
issues and ensuring a transparent approach along 
with timely communication with customers and other 
stakeholders.
in addition to the debt collection case, the new 
remediation unit is currently also overseeing 
remediation of the following legacy issues, as previously 
communicated:
• 
 wrong profi t and loss reporting for custody 
accounts, which for some customers have resulted 
in wrong tax reporting. 
• 
 issues relating to the handling of dividend tax, which 
have resulted in delays in tax reclaims. 
• 
 wrong registration of rebates on specifi c trades 
(fx trades).
• 
 for some customers, repayment terms have been 
set in such a way that the term of their loan is very 
long or infi nite. 
• 
 discrepancies between investment profi les and 
investment agreements that may have meant that 
some customers have received a lower – or in some 
cases a higher – return than agreed. 
• 
 for a number of business customers, danske bank 
has charged unjustifi ed credit renewal fees.
the fi nancial consequences of these matters for danske 
bank have either already been recognised or are not 
deemed material.
we are working hard to remediate these issues and will 
contact and compensate affected customers as soon as 
possible.
while we cannot guarantee that other issues will not 
emerge in the remediation process, we remain committed 
to solving any issue that emerges with transparency and 
to compensate all affected customers.

financial review
2020 vs 2019
in 2020, profi t before loan impairment charges 
amounted to dkk 13.9 billion (2019: dkk 15.8 billion). 
the development related mainly to higher expenses 
due to remediation and transformation costs and lower 
income, as 2019 benefi ted from several non-recurring 
items.
net profi t amounted to dkk 4.6 billion (2019: 
dkk 15.1 billion), which was just above our 
expectations. net profi t was heavily affected by the 
corona crisis, primarily in the form of loan impairment 
charges, which increased to dkk 7.0 billion (2019: 
dkk 1.5 billion). further, net profi t for 2019 benefi ted 
from danske bank’s exit from the international joint 
taxation scheme.
income
net interest income was stable at dkk 21.9 billion. 
there were positive effects from deposit and lending 
volumes, higher deposit margins and an increase 
in amortisation of loan origination fees. there was 
also a positive effect from structural changes to the 
group’s funding and liquidity management. the positive 
developments were, however, offset by adverse 
exchange-rate developments, lower lending margins, 
higher funding costs and a fall in other interest income 
from, among other things, mortgage lending activities.
net fee income was stable at dkk 15.1 billion 
(2019: dkk 15.2 billion). net fee income at wealth 
management increased. in asset management, net fee 
income increased due to record-high performance fees. 
in danica pension, net fee income increased due to 
higher risk allowance fees and positive results from risk 
products, for example the health and accident business. 
at corporates & institutions, net fee income from capital 
markets offerings increased. the increases were offset 
by the effects of the corona crisis at banking dk, which 
resulted in a decline in card use and transaction-related 
fees. further, net fee income was affected by lower 
income from a distribution agreement in finland. net fee

danske bank / annual report 2020
income in 2019 was affected by the compensation paid 
to customers in relation to the flexinvest fri product, the 
effect of which was partly offset by high remortgaging 
activity. 
net trading income totalled dkk 4.9 billion (2019: 
dkk 5.4 billion) and thus increased dkk 0.3 billion, 
when taking the sale of lr realkredit a/s in 2019 
into account. net trading income at corporates & 
institutions, fi&c, increased due to higher customer 
activity, improved market conditions and positive 
value adjustments of the derivatives portfolio (xva). 
this development was partly offset by a decrease in 
net trading income at wealth management, caused 
largely by a lower investment result, which includes 
provisions for pension yield tax in relation to the health 
and accident business for this year and previous years 
and the clean-up of accounting balances after the 
merger of danica pension and the former seb pension. 
furthermore, income from remortgaging activity at 
banking dk decreased.
other income amounted to dkk 0.5 billion, against 
dkk 2.5 billion in 2019. the decrease in other income 
was due mainly to other income in 2019 benefi ting from 
the gain on the sale of danica pension sweden and the 
change in the presentation of danica pension in the 
financial highlights as described in note g3.
expenses
operating expenses amounted to dkk 28.1 billion, an 
increase of 3% from the level in 2019, which is at the 
lower end of our guided range for 2020. underlying 
costs started to decrease in the second half of the 
year as the initial effects of the cost transformation 
are beginning to show and as a consequence of lower 
spending due to the corona crisis. this was, however, 
more than countered by higher remediation costs, 
which totalled dkk 4.1 billion as guided and related to 
compliance, fi nancial crime prevention and the estonia 
case. further, expenses were affected by transformation 
costs, which amounted to around dkk 1.7 billion, 
including provisions for restructuring costs in 2020 and 
partly in 2021.
impairment charges for other tangible assets
due to our transformation efforts and organisational 
changes, software of dkk 0.4 billion (2019: dkk 0.4 
billion) was impaired.
loan impairments
loan impairments in core activities amounted to 
dkk 7.0 billion (2019: dkk 1.5 billion). in the fourth 
quarter, the macroeconomic scenarios and weights 
were updated following a similar update of the group’s 
nordic outlook. the downside has become a w-shape 
scenario with positive trends for 2021 following a 
second-wave impact during the winter. on the basis 
of timely estimates applied in the group’s impairment 
process, loan impairments include a charge of 
dkk 2.4 billion to cover the effects of the limited 
visibility caused by the corona crisis. the impairment 
charges are a combination of specifi c adjustments for 
industries expected to be impacted by the corona crisis 
and charges due to the updating of macroeconomic 
scenarios. impairments relating to specifi c customers 
amounted to dkk 4.6 billion, of which a part also relates 
to the corona crisis. this includes charges relating to 
the oil and gas industry, as uncertainty in the offshore 
segment continues to exist. despite the above, credit 
quality remained overall strong.
at the business units, corporates & institutions 
saw loan impairments primarily against single-name 
exposures, mainly in the oil and gas industry and, to a 
smaller extent, in the retailing industry. banking nordic 
was affected by an increase in total impairments 
following charges made against single-name 
exposures and charges occasioned by the changed 
macroeconomic outlook. at banking dk, charges were 
driven by the continuously limited visibility relating to the 
effects of the corona crisis, however, with limited credit 
deterioration observed.

tax
tax on profi t for the period amounted to dkk 1.7 billion, 
or 27.2% of profi t before tax, against 22% of profi t 
before tax for 2019 adjusted for the specifi c changes in 
deferred tax. the increase in the effective tax rate was 
due primarily to expenses that are expected to be non-
deductible.
q4 2020 vs q3 2020
in the fourth quarter, the group posted a net profi t of 
dkk 1.5 billion, against dkk 2.1 billion in the third 
quarter. loan impairment charges fell to dkk 0.7 
billion, a decrease of 30%. however, this positive 
effect was more than offset by an increase in 
operating expenses related to transformation costs 
and impairment charges on other intangible assets.
net interest income amounted to dkk 5.4 billion, 
a 2% decrease from the level in the third quarter of 
2020. there were positive effects from lower funding 
costs, favourable exchange rate developments, 
higher deposit volumes and an increase in 
amortisation of loan origination fees. however, 
these effects were more than offset by the negative 
effects from lower deposit and lending margins as 
well as lower lending volumes. we also saw lower 
income at the internal bank from managing short-
term liquidity in the fourth quarter. 
net fee income amounted to dkk 4.5 billion, an 
increase of 32% from the level in the third quarter 
of 2020. the increase was due to seasonality 
at corporates & institutions, capital markets. at 
wealth management, performance fees from asset 
management booked in the fourth quarter of 2020 
had a positive effect on net fee income. some of the 
effect was offset by lower income from a distribution 
agreement in finland.
net trading income decreased to dkk 1.1 billion 
(q3 2020: dkk 1.5 billion). the decrease was due 
mainly to provisions for pension yield tax in relation 
to the health and accident business for previous 
years and the clean-up of accounting balances after 
the merger of danica pension and the former 
seb pension.
operating expenses increased to dkk 7.7 billion 
from dkk 6.7 billion in the third quarter. the 
increase was driven primarily by the transformation 
efforts and also included restructuring costs not only 
for the fourth quarter of 2020 but also partly for 
2021. 
impairment charges for software related mainly 
to our transformation efforts and organisational 
changes and amounted to dkk 0.4 billion in the 
fourth quarter of 2020.
loan impairments amounted to dkk 0.7 billion, 
against dkk 1.0 billion in the third quarter of 2020. 
loan impairments relating to specifi c customers 
amounted to dkk 0.5 billion. in the fourth quarter, 
the macroeconomic scenarios were updated. the 
effect of these updates amounted to a reversal of 
dkk 0.5 billion. however, given continually clouded 
visibility regarding the corona crisis, additional 
impairments of dkk 0.3 billion were booked to 
cover specifi c adjustments for industries likely 
to be affected by the corona crisis. further, dkk 
0.4 billion was booked in relation to the continued 
implementation of revised eba guidelines and 
dkk 0.1 billion was booked at banking dk. overall 
charges for banking dk and banking nordic were 
unchanged, while corporates & institutions saw 
charges driven by single-name exposures, mainly in 
the oil & gas and retailing industries.

danske bank / annual report 2020
lending
at the end of 2020, total lending was up 1% from the 
level at the end of 2019. at banking nordic, lending 
grew in most market areas. sweden and norway saw 
growth in the retail segment, finland mostly saw growth 
in the commercial segment. at corporates & institutions, 
lending also increased, despite a decrease in bank 
lending towards the end of the year. this was partly 
offset by a decrease in lending at banking dk as lending 
volumes were adversely affected by lower demand for 
credit among commercial and retail customers, refl ecting 
the general uncertainty caused by the corona crisis. for 
commercial customers in particular, the decline was 
driven not only by uncertainty but also by the substantial 
relief packages offered by the government, including tax 
postponement and salary compensation schemes.
in denmark, new gross lending, excluding repo loans, 
amounted to dkk 87.2 billion (2019: dkk 72.8 billion) 
due to an increase in fi xed-term loans in denmark. 
lending to retail customers accounted for dkk 26.0 
billion (2019: dkk 28.2 billion) of this amount. the 
decrease in retail lending related to home loans. 
the main increase in market share occurred in finland, 
where our market share rose to 9.9% from 9.6% in 
2019. in denmark, our market share of total lending, 
excluding repo loans, decreased to 25.5% from 26.2% 
in 2019 due primarily to decreasing market shares in the 
retail segment of the mortgage credit market and in the 
commercial segment of the banking market.

credit exposure
credit exposure from lending activities in core segments 
increased to dkk 2,728 billion, against dkk 2,444 
billion at the end of 2019, driven primarily by a 
dkk 169 billion increase in deposits with central banks 
and due from credit institutions and central banks and 
an increase in loans and loan offers at corporates & 
institutions and at banking nordic.
risk management 2020, section (3), which is available 
at danskebank.com/ir, provides details on danske bank’s 
credit risks.
credit quality
credit quality remained overall strong in most segments 
in 2020. the effects of the corona crisis are expected 
to materialise in the coming quarters. total net non-
performing loans (npl) decreased dkk 2.5 billion from 
the end of 2019. the decrease was due to a few single-
name exposures to the capital goods and shipping, oil 
& gas industries at corporates & institutions, with the 
effect being partly offset by an increase in npl related 
to single-name exposures in the hotels, restaurants and 
leisure, transportation and consumer goods industries at 
banking nordic and the retailing industry at corporates 
& institutions. the coverage ratio decreased slightly to 
75% from 78% at the end of 2019.

trading and investment activities
credit exposure from trading and investment activities 
amounted to dkk 1,239 billion at the end of 2020, 
against dkk 1,124 billion at the end of 2019. the 
increase was due primarily to increased positive market 
values of derivatives, increased bond holdings and repo 
deposits.
the group has made netting agreements with many of its 
counterparties concerning positive and negative market 
values of derivatives. the net exposure was dkk 109.6 
billion, against dkk 76.4 billion at the end of 2019. 
the value of the bond portfolio was dkk 583 billion, 
against dkk 473 billion at the end of 2019. of the total 
bond portfolio, 77% was recognised at fair value and 
23% at amortised cost.

trading portfolio assets and trading portfolio liabilities 
increased from net assets of dkk 43.1 billion at the end 
of 2019 to net assets of dkk 183.6 billion at the end 
of 2020. the increase in net assets was due mainly to 
increased bond holdings and increased positive values of 
derivatives.
other balance sheet items 
due from credit institutions and central banks increased 
dkk 172 billion from the end of 2019. the increase was 
due to general liquidity management. more information 
on this is provided under the funding and liquidity 
heading in the capital and liquidity management section.
assets under insurance contracts, including derivatives, 
and liabilities under insurance contracts increased 
dkk 50.7 billion and dkk 56.0 billion, respectively, from 
the end of 2019, primarily as a result of the positive 
developments on the fi nancial markets.
28
danske bank / annual report 2020
the main purposes of our capital management practices 
are to support our business strategy and to ensure 
a suffi cient level of capital to withstand even severe 
downturns without breaching regulatory requirements.
capital ratios 
at the end of 2020, the total capital ratio was 23.0%, 
and the cet1 capital ratio was 18.3%, against 22.7% 
and 17.3%, respectively, at the end of 2019. the 
movement in the capital ratios in 2020 was driven by 
the cancellation of dividends for 2019, the accumulated 
net profi t for 2020 and changes to ifrs 9 transitional 
arrangements. the total capital ratio was further 
affected by a redemption of additional tier 1 capital 
instruments, which was partly offset by net issues of tier 
2 capital, resulting in a 0.3 percentage point increase in 
the total capital ratio.
during 2020, the total rea increased by approximately 
dkk 17 billion, due mainly to the effect of initial 
implementation of the eba guidelines and two swedish 
corporate residential and commercial real estate 
risk weight fl oors implemented in december 2020. 
these increases were partly countered by the early 
implementation of the crr ii sme supporting factor in 
june 2020. 
capital requirements 
danske bank’s capital management policies are based 
on the internal capital adequacy assessment process 
(icaap). in this process, danske bank determines its 
solvency need ratio. the solvency need ratio consists of 
the 8% minimum capital requirement under pillar i and 
an individual capital add-on under pillar ii.
at the end of 2020, the group’s solvency need ratio 
was 12.6%, a slight decrease of 0.1 percentage points 
from the level at the end of 2019. 
the solvency need still includes the dkk 10 billion 
required under the orders issued by the danish fsa 
in 2018 as a consequence of the estonia case. the 
amount is covered by common equity tier 1 (cet1) 
capital, as ordered by the danish fsa.
a combined buffer requirement (cbr) applies in addition 
to the solvency need ratio. at the end of 2020, the 
group’s combined capital buffer requirement was 5.6%.
in march 2020, as a result of the corona crisis, the 
danish minister for industry, business and financial 
affairs decided to release the countercyclical buffer 
requirement and cancel the planned increases intended 
to take effect in 2020. the swedish fsa also released 
the swedish buffer requirement, while the norwegian 
ministry of finance decreased the norwegian buffer 
requirement from 2.5% to 1% with immediate effect.

combined capital buffer requirement is described in 
more detail in section 5 of risk management 2020, 
which is available at danskebank.com/ir.
minimum requirement for own funds and eligible 
liabilities
the group received an updated decision from the danish 
fsa on the minimum requirement for own funds and 
eligible liabilities (mrel) on 28 december 2020 based 
on q2 2020 data. the requirement is set at two times 
the solvency need and one time the sifi buffer and 
capital conservation buffer. further, the cbr must now 
be met in addition to the mrel. at the end of 2020, the 
capital and liquidity 
management
29
danske bank / annual report 2020
requirement was equivalent to dkk 200 billion and 
dkk 237 billion with the cbr considered in addition 
to the mrel, corresponding to 30.5% and 36.1% of 
the rea adjusted for realkredit danmark, respectively. 
taking the deduction of capital and debt buffer 
requirements in realkredit danmark into account, mrel 
eligible liabilities amounted to dkk 279 billion.
the transition to the full mrel has been relatively 
shorter for the group than for its peers. in combination 
with a relatively high danish mrel, the group has 
issued a signifi cant amount of non-preferred senior debt 
over the past couple of years. 
the danish fsa has set the subordination requirement 
as the higher of 8% of tlof and two times the solvency 
need and one time the cbr.
at the end of 2020, the subordination requirement was 
equivalent to dkk 201 billion. subordinated mrel-
eligible liabilities stood at dkk 242 billion.
leverage ratio
with the adoption of capital requirements regulation 
2 (crr2), a minimum leverage ratio requirement of 3% 
will be introduced in the second quarter of 2021. at the 
end of december 2020, the group’s leverage ratio was 
4.5% under the transitional rules and 4.4% under the 
fully-phased in rules.
capital targets 
the cet1 capital ratio target was kept at above 16% 
in the short term to ensure a suffi ciently prudent buffer 
in relation to the capital requirement. the total capital 
target was kept at above 20%. danske bank fully meets 
these capital targets.
the board of directors will continue to adapt capital 
targets to regulatory developments in order to ensure a 
strong capital position. 
capital distribution policy
as our capital position continues to be strong, the board 
of directors is proposing a dividend of dkk 2.0 per 
share. this is in line with the recommendations issued 
by the danish fsa for capital preservation due to the 
uncertainty associated with the corona crisis. 
going forward, danske bank’s general dividend policy 
is unchanged, and it is still our ambition to pay out 40-
60% of net profi t for the year.
in order to support the initiatives aimed at minimising 
the economic consequences of the corona crisis, no 
dividends were paid for 2019. 
danske bank has strong capital and liquidity positions, 
and the board of directors monitors the situation closely 
and remains committed to returning excess capital to 
shareholders when the economic impact of the corona 
crisis is clear.
credit ratings 
in 2020, all credit rating agencies incorporated the 
impact of the corona crisis in their ratings.
on 31 march, fitch ratings (fitch) placed its long-term 
ratings on danske bank on watch negative due to the 
sharp deterioration of economic conditions caused by 
the corona crisis. at the same time, it downgraded its 
subordinated tier 2 debt ratings to ‘bbb+’ from ‘a-‘ and 
upgraded its additional tier 1 capital instrument ratings 
to ‘bbb-‘ from ‘bb+’. these changes refl ected previously 
announced changes to ratings criteria.
at the same time, fitch affi rmed its ratings and revised 
its outlook on realkredit danmark to negative from 
stable. the change in outlook also refl ects the expected 
consequences of the corona crisis. however, fitch 
expects the effects for realkredit danmark to be less 
negative than for the group as a whole and more 
manageable relative to earnings and capitalisation.
on 19 june, fitch removed its ratings from rating 
watch negative and affi rmed its ratings of danske 
bank. at the same time, fitch assigned a negative 
outlook to danske bank’s ‘a’ issuer rating. the negative 
outlook refl ects the economic uncertainties relating 
to the fallout from the corona crisis and the fi nancial 
uncertainties relating to the estonia case. at the time, 
fitch revised its outlook for realkredit danmark from 
negative back to stable.
s&p global ratings (s&p) and moody’s investors 
service (moody’s) took no rating action in respect of 
danske bank / annual report 2020

danske bank in 2020. s&p affi rmed its ratings and 
outlook for danske bank on 2 july, 21 september and 
16 december, and moody’s affi med its ratings and 
outlook for danske bank on 19 june, 23 september and 
18 december. 
moody’s and s&p have a stable outlook for danske 
bank, whereas fitch retains its negative outlook. the 
outlooks refl ect the economic uncertainties relating 
to the fallout from the corona crisis and the fi nancial 
uncertainties relating to the estonia case.

the covered bonds issued from capital centre t to 
‘aaa’ (stable outlook) from ‘aa+’ (stable outlook) on 
8 january 2021, due to a lowering of the required 
overcollateralisation.
covered bonds (sdo) issued by danske bank a/s are

covered bonds issued by danske mortgage bank plc 
are rated ‘aaa’ by moody’s and covered bonds issued by 
danske hypotek ab are rated ‘aaa’ (stable outlook) by 
s&p and, as of 30 april, ‘aaa’ by nordic credit rating.
esg ratings
esg (environmental, social and governance) ratings 
cover analytical activities that address a business’s 
societal impact. esg analysis may include a broad range 
of sub-assessments, and defi nitions vary considerably 
among research providers.
unlike credit ratings, esg ratings are unsolicited and in 
principle based on publicly available information.

dansk bank made the cdp worldwide climate change 
b list in 2020, an improvement from the c list in 
2019, which puts the group second only to the 271 
companies on the a list.
in december, iss esg ratings upgraded its rating of 
danske bank to ‘c+’ from ‘c’ due to a reassessment 
of risk weights relating to business ethics, and also in 
december, msci esg ratings upgraded its esg rating 
of danske bank to ‘bb’ from ‘b’, due to the strong 
performance of danske bank’s green fi nancing.
in december, sustainalytics lowered its esg risk rating 
for danske bank to high risk from medium risk, due 
primarily to an error correction.
funding and liquidity 
the corona crisis continued to impact the market for 
credit in the second half of 2020, though credit markets 
generally improved considerably from conditions in the 
fi rst half of the year.
during 2020, the group issued non-preferred senior 
bonds of dkk 23.7 billion, senior debt of dkk 19.9 
billion, covered bonds of dkk 31.4 billion and tier 
2 capital of dkk 3.7 billion, bringing total long-term 
wholesale funding to dkk 78.7 billion. 
our strategy of securing more funding directly in our 
main lending currencies, including nok and sek, 
danske bank / annual report 2020
31
remains in place, but we will also utilise central bank 
facilities to obtain funding in the most cost-effi cient 
manner.
we plan for regular issues in the eur benchmark format 
in covered bonds, senior and non-preferred senior 
bonds as well as issues in the domestic usd market 
for senior and non-preferred senior bonds in the rule 
144a format. the benchmark issues are expected to be 
supplemented by private placements of bonds.
from time to time, we will issue in gbp, jpy, chf 
and other currencies when market conditions allow. 
issuance plans for subordinated debt in either the 
additional tier 1 or tier 2 formats will depend on 
balance-sheet growth and redemptions on the one side 
and our capital targets on the other. any issuance of 
subordinated debt may cover part of our funding need. 
note g22 provides more information about the issuing 
of bonds in 2020.
danske bank’s liquidity position remained robust. stress 
tests show that we have a suffi cient liquidity buffer well 
beyond 12 months. at the end of 2020, our liquidity 
coverage ratio stood at 154% (31 december 2019: 
140%), with an lcr reserve of dkk 710 billion (31 
december 2019: dkk 432 billion).
the requirement for the net stable funding ratio forms an 
integral part of our funding planning, and we are already 
comfortably adhering to the requirement.
at 31 december 2020, the total nominal value of 
outstanding long-term funding, excluding equity-
accounted additional tier 1 capital and debt issued 
by realkredit danmark, was dkk 384 billion. (31 
december 2019: dkk 370 billion).
the supervisory diamond 
the danish fsa has identifi ed a number of specifi c risk 
indicators for banks and mortgage institutions and has 
set threshold values with which all danish banks must 
comply. the requirements are known as the supervisory 
diamond.
at the end of 2020, danske bank was in compliance 
with all threshold values. a separate report is available 
at danskebank.com/ir.
realkredit danmark also complies with all threshold 
values.
new regulation 
in december 2017, the basel committee on 
banking supervision (bcbs) published the fi nal 
and revised standards for rea calculations (basel 
iv). due to the corona crisis, the bcbs has delayed 
the implementation of the basel iv standards from 
2022 to 2023. this will also delay the process for 
implementation of the standards in the eu, and the eu 
commission is now expected to publish a legislative 
proposal in the fi rst half of 2021.
the danish implementation of the eu banking package 
(crd iv and brrd ii) was adopted by the danish 
parliament in december 2020 and took effect on 
28 december 2020. the group expects the danish 
implementation of the eu banking package to have a 
limited impact on the group’s capital and rea. 
as part of the european banking authority’s (eba) 
roadmap to enhance internal models used to calculate 
credit risk, danske bank has started implementing the 
revised set of eba guidelines and technical standards, 
which caused rea increases in 2020. we expect 
further increases amounting to around dkk 30 billion 
in the fi rst half of 2021, all else equal, and increases 
again in the second half of 2021. 
in october 2020, the danish implementation of the eu 
covered bonds package was published for consultation. 
the draft legislation is expected to be presented to 
the danish parliament in the fi rst quarter of 2021.the 
rules include a requirement for a cover pool liquidity 
buffer and stipulate eligible cover pool assets. further, 
a new requirement for a minimum level of cover pool 
overcollateralisation is introduced. on the basis of the 
draft legislation, the new rules are expected to have a 
limited impact on the group.

general meeting
the general meeting is danske bank’s highest decision-
making authority.
in 2020, the annual general meeting was held on 9 
june. the originally scheduled general meeting on 17 
march 2020 was postponed upon recommendation 
from the danish financial supervisory authority due to 
uncertainty about whether the meeting could be held in 
accordance with the health and safety guidelines issued 
by the danish authorities.
danske bank’s articles of association are available 
at danskebank.com/about-us/corporate-governance 
and contain information about the notice convening the 
general meeting, shareholders’ admission and voting 
rights as well as shareholders’ right to submit proposals 
and have specifi ed business transacted at the meeting.
all shareholders have voting rights according to the 
number of shares held at the date of registration, and 
each share of dkk 10 carries one vote. no share has 
any special rights attached to it.
only the general meeting can amend the articles of 
association. an amendment requires not less than 
a two-thirds majority of the votes cast and not less 
than two-thirds of the share capital represented at the 
general meeting and entitled to vote.
a resolution to wind up danske bank by merger or 
voluntary liquidation can be passed only if adopted by 
not less than three-quarters of the votes cast and not 
less than three-quarters of the share capital represented 
at the general meeting and entitled to vote.
board of directors
the board consists of thirteen members, nine elected by 
the general meeting and four elected by and among the 
employees.
board members elected by the general meeting stand 
for election every year. as prescribed by danish law, 
members elected by and among the employees serve on 
the board of directors for a four-year term, with the next 
election to be held prior to the annual general meeting in 
2022.
the nomination committee operates as a preparatory 
committee for the board of directors with respect to the 
identifi cation and selection, as well as the competency 
and suitability assessment of candidates to the board of 
directors and to the executive leadership team. board 
candidates are nominated by the board of directors 
or the shareholders and are elected by the general 
meeting. 
raija-leena hankonen and martin blessing were

organisation and management
in the fourth quarter, the board of directors carried out 
the annual evaluation of the board of directors, including 
its composition, the work on the board committees, the 
committee structure and the leadership of the board 
chairman. to ensure anonymity, an external consulting 
fi rm facilitated the evaluation. all members of the 
board of directors and the executive leadership team 
answered comprehensive questionnaires. the fi ndings 
and conclusions were subsequently presented to and 
discussed by the board of directors. 
the aim of the evaluation was to ensure, among other 
things, that the composition of the board of directors 
as well as the special competencies of each board 
member enable the board of directors to perform its 
tasks. as the board of directors operates as a collegial 
body, its overall competencies and experience are the 
sum of the individual board members’ competencies and 
experience. the composition of the board of directors 
aims to ensure the stable and satisfactory development 
of danske bank for the benefi t of its customers, 
employees, shareholders and other stakeholders. the 
competencies of the board of directors collectively 
are described in the competency profi le, which is 
available on danskebank.com. pages 244-249 provide 
information on the competencies of the individual board 
members. 
the results of the 2020 evaluation were overall good 
and showing good alignment both within the board of 
directors and between the board of directors and the 
executive leadership team. the board of directors will 
work on the agreed focus areas in 2021.

corporate governance recommendations
corporate governance recommendations issued by 
the danish committee on corporate governance 
are available at corporategovernance.dk. the 
recommendations are best practice guidelines for the 
management of companies with shares admitted for 
trading on a regulated market in denmark, including 
nasdaq copenhagen a/s. if a company fails to comply 
with a recommendation, it must explain why it has 
danske bank / annual report 2020

chosen a different approach. danske bank complies with 
all recommendations.

accordance with section 134 of the danish fsa’s 
executive order of financial reports for credit 
institutions and investment firms etc. section 107b of 
the danish financial statements act, and the nasdaq 
nordic main market rulebook for issuers of shares 
(“main market rulebook”), is available at danskebank.
com/about-us/corporate-governance. the report 
includes an explanation of danske bank’s status on all 
recommendations.
the danish bankers association, which is now part of 
finance denmark, has issued a corporate governance 
code, which danske bank must comply with or explain 
why it does not comply. the corporate governance code 
is available on fi nansdanmark.dk. danske bank complies 
with all recommendations set out in the code. danske 
bank’s explanation of the status on all recommendations 
is included in section e of its corporate governance 
report 2020.
new business segments
on 25 august 2020, the group announced changes to 
the organisation. the aim of the redesigned organisation 
the effect of these changes on the fi nancial highlights for 2020 are presented in the table below.
is to reduce complexity, increase effi ciency and become 
even more competitive for our customers. going 
forward, our commercial activities will be organised in 
four reporting business units:
• 
 personal & business customers, which will serve 
personal customers and small and medium-sized 
corporates across all nordic markets
• 
 large corporates & institutions, which will serve 
large corporates and institutional customers across 
all nordic markets
• 
danica pension
• 
northern ireland 
furthermore, going forward, earnings from danica 
pension will be presented as net income from insurance 
business due to danica pension now being a separate 
business unit. this will also increase transparency and 
simplicity in the income statement, as danica pension’s 
business model is very different from that of the rest of 
the group. 
the table below shows the impact on the fi nancial 
highlights. the interim report for the fi rst quarter of 
2021 will refl ect the new structure, and comparative 
fi gures for 2020 will be restated.

the year 2020 was marked by the corona crisis, and we introduced several supporting initiatives to help our customers 
in the best way possible. we continued to make progress on the journey towards becoming a better bank by launching 
a number of business initiatives, including the new fi xed-rate flexlife® loan type and a number of services to support 
the green transition. a new set-up for serving retail customers and a new offering to mass-affl uent customers to be 
implemented in 2021 were also announced. in relation to commercial customers, we continued to strengthen our role 
as our customers’ strategic fi nancial adviser. profi t before loan impairment charges fell dkk 1.7 billion as operating 
expenses increased due to remediation and transformation costs, while total income was negatively affected by 
the corona crisis. profi t before tax was adversely affected by the increase in loan impairment charges refl ecting the 
uncertainty related to the corona crisis.

danske bank / annual report 2020
2020 vs 2019 
customer activity
in mid-march, the coronavirus hit denmark with 
immediate, adverse effects on society, businesses 
and households. consequently, we launched multiple 
initiatives to help our customers in the best way 
possible, including access to overdraft facilities, 
interest-only payments on loans, postponement of debt 
repayment, increase and extension of credit facilities, 
and interest- and fee-exempt holiday loans.
we also reached out proactively to thousands of 
commercial customers to offer advice on business 
planning and on how to protect their business. this 
was very well received by customers, which helped 
strengthen our relations with them. 
many retail customers contacted us with questions 
regarding the coronavirus situation. we focused our 
resources on assisting with advice and support, for 
example regarding how to postpone debt repayment, 
apply for credit facilities to pay bills because of income 
loss or get loans to fi nance holidays. 
as a result of the corona restrictions, we also saw 
a further increase in customers’ use of our digital 
channels, including online meetings with their advisers.
customers’ appetite for loans did, however, decline, and 
their savings increased, refl ecting the high uncertainty 
caused by the situation.
financial results
income at banking dk decreased dkk 0.8 billion in 
2020 from the level in 2019. although the result was 
negatively affected by the corona crisis, this effect was 
somewhat mitigated by the introduction of negative 
deposit rates. profi t before loan impairment charges was 
also affected by an increase in operating expenses of 
dkk 0.9 billion and thus fell dkk 1.7 billion. an increase 
in loan impairment charges of dkk 1.2 billion due to 
the uncertainty related to the corona crisis resulted in a 
decrease in profi t before tax of dkk 3.0 billion.
lending volumes were adversely affected by lower 
demand for credit among commercial and retail 
customers, refl ecting the general uncertainty caused 
by the corona crisis. for commercial customers in 
particular, the decline was driven not only by uncertainty 
but also by the substantial relief packages offered by 
the government, including tax postponement and salary 
compensation schemes.
deposits, on the other hand, increased as businesses 
scaled down investments, deferred dividend payments 
and increased liquidity buffers. for retail customers, we 
saw a tendency to hold back on investments and reduce 
spending. 
net interest income fell 2% following the decrease in 
lending volumes triggered by lower demand for credit 
among commercial customers and customers switching 
to loan and mortgage products with lower margins. 
in june, negative interest rates were also introduced 
for retail customers with signifi cant deposits, which 
somewhat offset the negative effect on net interest 
income. 
net fee income was also adversely affected by the 
corona crisis and fell 8%, mainly as a result of a decline 
in card use and transaction-related fees. moreover, the 
2019 net fee income level was high because of the 
strong remortgaging activity driven by historically low 
interest rates.
net trading income decreased as a result of higher 
remortgaging activity in 2019 than in 2020 combined 
with lower activity, especially within foreign exchange, 
due to the corona crisis.
operating expenses rose 10% owing to an increase 
in costs for and in the number of staff working with 
fi nancial crime prevention, other regulatory requirements 
and compliance activities, including monitoring and 
controls, staff training and it. costs for the better bank 
transformation, including restructuring, also contributed 
to the increase.
the increase in loan impairment charges to dkk 0.9 
billion was driven by the changed outlook and potential 
downside risk for the portfolio caused by the uncertainty 
resulting from the corona crisis. we continued to see 
limited impairments from actual credit deterioration.
credit quality
credit quality remained strong overall in 2020. some 
credit deterioration in the commercial portfolio was 
observed in the spring, but since then, the development 
danske bank / annual report 2020
42
has been stable in both the commercial and the retail 
portfolio. overall, the effects of the corona crisis on 
the retail customer portfolio were modest. however, 
uncertainty remains high, and we remain vigilant in 
terms of any possible deterioration.
credit exposure
credit exposure decreased to dkk 1,034 billion from 
dkk 1,054 billion at the end of 2019, driven by a 
dkk 31 billion decline in the commercial portfolio.
q4 2020 vs q3 2020   
profi t before tax decreased in the fourth quarter of 
2020 from the level in the third quarter, driven by 
higher operating expenses.
net interest income decreased, primarily because of 
deposit margin pressure.
net fee income increased, due to higher 
remortgaging activities in the fourth quarter and a 
provision for service fees made in the third quarter 
of 2020.
operating expenses increased due to transformation 
costs as well as provisions for remediation cases 
and seasonality.
the fourth quarter of 2020 saw a net loan 
impairment charge of dkk 70 million, against a net 
charge of dkk 228 million in the third quarter. the 
charge covers additional post-model adjustments 
following the uncertainty related to the corona 
crisis as well as a reversal resulting from updated 
macroeconomic expectations, which were more 
positive than third quarter expectations. 
business initiatives
despite the extraordinary events of 2020, we 
accelerated our efforts to become an even better bank. 
we supported our customers through the turmoil 
resulting from the corona crisis, and at the same time, 
we worked dedicatedly on executing on our better bank 
strategy to the benefi t of all of our stakeholders. 
retail customers
flexlife® loan with ﬁ xed interest rate
home fi nancing and advisory services are a cornerstone 
of our business, and we continued to develop our 
offering.
in august, realkredit danmark launched a fi xed-
rate version of the flexlife® loan. the new version 
complements the successful flexlife® variable-rate 
mortgage loan launched back in 2017. the loan was the 
fi rst to allow homeowners to combine a fi xed interest 
rate with an interest-only period of up to 30 years and 
adjust their monthly payments along the way if their 
needs or plans change without the hassle and costs 
associated with switching from one loan to another. the 
new loan has been very well received by customers, 
and since its launch, we have issued fi xed-rate flexlife®
loans for close to dkk 8 billion.
new service model 
in 2021, we will introduce a new customer service 
model. across branches and other advisory units, we 
will have a shared responsibility for customers while 
at the same time further strengthening specialist 
competencies. this will enable us to provide even better 
advisory services whenever and wherever customers 
want to meet us, for example during busy remortgaging 
periods, when we will be able to agilely reallocate 
adviser capacity. furthermore, the setup will allow us 
to collaborate better and more effi ciently across the 
organisation and position us to meet future regulatory 
requirements.
transactions at cashier’s desks in our branches have 
declined by more than 90% over the past ten years. the 
trend refl ects customers’ preference for doing their day-
to-day banking via their mobile banking and ebanking 
solutions, and making payments using their cards and 
mobile phone. the corona crisis has only added to this 
trend, and in 2021, we will therefore, as announced in 
november 2020, signifi cantly reduce the number of 
branches with cashier’s desks.
danske bank / annual report 2020
43
new offering to mass-afﬂ uent customers 
to further strengthen our appeal to mass-affl uent 
customers and our position in this attractive market, 
we will introduce a new offering in 2021 that caters 
to this customer group’s more complex fi nancial and 
advisory needs. it will include access to wealth advisers 
specialising in asset planning and investment, a new 
fi nancial planning simulation tool that provides an easy 
overview and targeted recommendations.
angel investor academy 
to help private banking customers looking to invest in 
growth businesses, we launched our angel investor 
academy. through keynote presentations by experts 
and established business angels, the academy offers 
participants the knowledge required to get started as 
business angels. the academy refl ects our strengths 
in relation to investment and growth businesses and 
is a building block in our ambition to become a more 
innovative and strategic fi nancial adviser.
award-winning mobile banking app
danske mobile banking is popular among our 
customers, who in a recent survey rated our digital 
solutions best in class relative to the solutions offered 
by our competitors. but also industry, it and cx 
professionals recognise our solution: at the european 
customer centricity awards, danske bank came in fi rst 
in the best use of mobile category, and at the global 
retail banking innovation awards, danske mobile 
banking won the best open banking initiative award.
we continue to add new features to the app, and 
in 2020, we added options such as the transfer of 
amounts to and from accounts with other banks and the 
option of viewing own card pins.  
commercial customers
strengthening our role as strategic ﬁ nancial partner 
the intensive contact with our commercial customers 
during the corona crisis has further strengthened 
our role as strategic fi nancial partner and underlined 
the demand for a targeted and relevant dialogue with 
customers about the future direction of their business. 
we continued our strategic adviser training with focus 
on topics such as crisis management, sustainability, 
value chains and business plans, and on how to balance 
fi nancial risks and opportunities. we also launched 
a number of external communication activities for 
customers, including the strategic business talks 
for medium-sized commercial customers looking for 
inspiration and advice on how to develop their business, 
and a new programme series in which small businesses 
discuss various dilemmas and get advice from 
experienced entrepreneurs and danske bank experts.
district
in 2020, we completed the migration of all business 
online customers to district – our online solution that 
makes it easy for businesses not only to do their day-
to-day banking but also to get a full overview of their 
fi nancial position and thus a strong basis for decision-
making. we continued to develop and further improve 
district with new innovative functionality, for example a 
real-time overview of accounts with other banks. 
new payment solution partnership 
new technology and alternative payment solutions are 
becoming increasingly important to our customers. in 
2020, we announced a new partnership with altapay, 
an international payment solutions provider, to develop 
simple, innovative and long-lasting solutions for receiving 
payments across channels, including online, in-store and 
mobile, with multiple international payment methods 
attached. our partnership with altapay is another 
example of initiatives to realise our ambition of helping 
our customers with more than just conventional banking 
services.
app to manage company receipts and expenses
together with zenegy, a tech start-up specialising 
in cloud-based salary systems, we developed a 
mastercard-based app that allows businesses and 
employees to easily keep track of business-related 
receipts, expenses and purchases. the app, to be 
launched in 2021, is a simple alternative to the 
time-consuming and expensive processes that many 
businesses have today, and it forms part of our ambition 
to offer customers a platform on which they can pick and 
choose the solutions they need.
danske bank / annual report 2020

a signiﬁ cant milestone for the hub
since we launched the hub, our start-up platform, 
together with rainmaking back in 2015, we have helped 
more than 7,500 start-ups with growth and funding 
tools and with meeting one of their most critical needs: 
bringing together the right team. more than 25,000 jobs 
have now been posted on the hub – and in the fourth 
quarter of 2020, we recorded the submission of job 
application number 500,000 through the platform. this 
makes the hub one of the most successful platforms to 
support nordic start-ups and growth businesses.
engagement and business with entrepreneur of the year 
once again, we participated as a danish partner in the 
ey entrepreneur of the year programme – a unique 
global programme that recognises entrepreneurial 
achievement among individuals and businesses. our 
partnership refl ects our commitment to support growth, 
innovation and sustainability, and it is an excellent 
opportunity to demonstrate our strategic fi nancial 
sparring expertise, grow our business with existing 
customers and attract new customers.
society
in line with our better bank ambitions, we are 
committed to contributing to sustainable progress, for 
example by making sustainable choices easy for our 
customers and by fi ghting fi nancial crime.
helping homeowners get started with energy 
improvements
buildings account for around 40% of energy 
consumption, and the energy saving potential for danish 
homes is thus crucial to ensuring future sustainability. 
at the same time, more and more homeowners focus on 
how they can save money on their energy bill and also 
live in a more sustainable way. 
in 2020, we launched a series of new activities that 
focus on reducing energy consumption and created a 
new website hub to give customers an easy overview of 
the help, services and products we offer customers to 
get started with energy improvements in their home.

among these initiatives is a partnership with ab 
gruppen, the provider of energihjem.dk, which is the 
largest danish internet portal for homeowners looking 
for advice on energy-saving solutions. in november, 
a brand new version of the portal was launched, 
making all relevant information about energy-saving 
improvements, including fi nancial aspects, easily 
accessible to homeowners. the energihjem.dk portal 
is an excellent opportunity for us to market danske 
bank as a competent adviser and provider of attractive 
solutions to homeowners looking to fi nance home and 
energy improvements. 
home-improvement and energy-saving report
together with obh, consulting engineers, we introduced 
a home improvement and energy-saving report to 
help homeowners get started. as part of the report, 
an experienced construction adviser goes through 
the home and provides recommendations on how to 
combine energy-saving improvements with other home 
improvements the owner wants to make, for example 
putting in a new kitchen.
attractive loans to ﬁ nance energy-saving solutions
we introduced attractive terms for retail customers 
who want to invest in energy-saving solutions for their 
homes. the loan can be either a mortgage loan from 
realkredit danmark or a danske bolig fri loan, a danske 
prioritet plus loan or another bank home loan.
increasing demand for green mortgage bonds
in 2019, realkredit danmark was the fi rst danish 
mortgage credit institution to launch green bonds in 
the danish market. the loans are based on rd cibor6® 
green and are offered to customers looking to fi nance 
commercial property with an a or b energy rating.
we saw a signifi cant increase in demand for green 
fi nancing from our commercial customers, and by the 
end of 2020, realkredit danmark’s green mortgage 
bond lending had reached a volume of around dkk 9.5 
billion.
favourable loan to ﬁ nance electric cars
to help accelerate the green transition and make electric 
cars a more attractive choice for our customers, we 
introduced a new loan option. the loan is offered at a 
0% variable interest rate and reduced establishment 
costs, and with the option of taking out car insurance 
with tryg, our insurance partner, on favourable terms.

environmentally friendly payment cards
large or small, we want to make sustainable choices 
simple for our customers. in 2020, we took the fi rst 
steps towards replacing existing payment cards with 
new environmentally friendly cards made from 86% 
recycled plastic. the goal is to replace all existing plastic 
cards used by danske bank customers. with this new 
initiative, we will be among the fi rst banks in the world to 
issue payment cards made of recycled plastic.
fighting ﬁ nancial crime
an important dimension of our commitment to having a 
positive impact on society is our contribution to fi ghting 
fi nancial crime. compliance is therefore a key focus area 
in our daily work. in 2020, we continued our training 
efforts and it investments and will do so also in 2021. 
for example, we will further expand employee training 
and dialogue to ensure that all employees across the 
organisation remain aware of their role and are well 
prepared to identify and act on unusual behaviour.
customer satisfaction
our focus on delivering the best customer experience 
and seamless customer journeys continues. 
satisfaction among both commercial and retail 
customers continued to grow in the fi rst half of the year. 
the positive trend was driven by a close dialogue with 
our customers during the corona crisis, proactively 
advising customers via one-on-one contact, etc. 
in the second half of the year, however, customer 
satisfaction declined following the extensive press 
coverage of a number of legacy issues.
our 2023 ambition for commercial and retail customer 
satisfaction is to be in the top two. at the end of 
2020, we were ranked on target among commercial 
customers. on retail customer satisfaction, we were 
ranked below target in a number fi ve position. against 
this background, we are more than ever committed to 
continuing our close dialogue with customers to offer 
them the best experience every time they are in touch 
with us.

banking nordic
in 2020, banking nordic continued to support customers through the effects of the corona crisis in combination 
with strong growth across most of our market areas. furthermore, banking nordic made progress in relation to 
the better bank transformation, most recently with the better nordic retail bank transformation initiative to create 
a stronger and more harmonised set-up for serving retail customers across the nordic countries combined with 
an acceleration of digital offerings. profi t before loan impairment charges decreased dkk 0.3 billion as operating 
expenses increased due to remediation and transformation costs. profi t before tax was affected by the corona crisis 
in the form of higher loan impairment charges.

danske bank / annual report 2020
2020 vs 2019 
customer activity
during 2020, banking nordic’s markets were hit by 
the corona crisis. the coronavirus pandemic created 
signifi cant turmoil on the global markets, and many 
countries decided on periods of lockdown, which 
impacted both businesses and societies as a whole. 
banking nordic launched several initiatives to support 
customers through the turmoil resulting from the 
corona crisis. in the weeks following the outbreak of the 
pandemic, many retail customers made use of initiatives 
such as interest-only periods on mortgage loans and 
a range of streaming services and live chats set up to 
specifi cally give advice in relation to the market situation 
resulting from the crisis.
a large number of customers in the large-customer 
segments were contacted with advice, and we have 
focused on the various corona crisis relief packages 
introduced by governments as well as on giving advice 
on tools to increase liquidity, including the establishment 
or extension of credit lines.
financial results
banking nordic’s income saw a fl at development from 
2019 to 2020. total underlying income increased, 
mainly on the basis of a combination of a favourable 
interest rate environment and growth across all market 
areas, especially in the retail business in sweden and 
norway, with a continuously good infl ow of customers. 
across our market areas, partnerships accounted for 
a signifi cant part of the customer infl ow and acted as a 
core lever for our growth strategies. some of the positive 
effects were, however, offset by lower income from a 
distribution agreement in banking finland.
overall, the fi nancial results were adversely affected by 
currency effects, as the norwegian krone depreciated 
vis-à-vis the danish krone during 2020. in addition, 
the turmoil resulting from the corona crisis lowered 
customer activity, which had an adverse infl uence on 
fees and trading. 
banking nordic saw growth in lending in most market 
areas from the levels at the end of 2019. however, 
while sweden and norway saw growth in the retail 
space, finland mostly saw growth in the commercial 
space. commercial lending in sweden and norway 
was heavily infl uenced by lower credit appetite due to 
general uncertainties because of the corona crisis as 
well as relief packages from the government. deposits 
increased due to a combination of the onboarding of 
hsb customers in sweden and government packages 
introduced as a result of the corona crisis and low 
consumer spending.
net interest income increased 3%, benefi ting from the 
development in the interest rate environment, especially 
the rate cuts made by the norwegian central bank but 
also the lower deposit margin pressure in sweden for 
part of the year. furthermore, the increase was also 
driven by growth generated by the partnership strategy.
net fee income decreased 9% from 2019 to 2020 due 
mainly to lower income from a distribution agreement in 
banking finland. the underlying development in net fee 
income was fl at from 2019 to 2020. although banking 
nordic saw dampened activity due to the corona crisis, 
investment activity picked up, especially in the latter half 
of 2020. 
net trading decreased as a result of lower activity, 
especially within foreign exchange, due to the corona 
crisis.
asset finance saw low investment activity in core 
markets, but still maintained a good development 
throughout 2020. the decrease in other income was 
due mainly to realisation of investment properties in 
2019.
banking nordic saw an increase in operating expenses 
of 5% from the level in 2019 due to ongoing compliance 
remediation as well as costs for the better bank 
transformation. underlying costs decreased due to 
restructuring and tight cost control.
loan impairments for the full year amounted to a 
net charge of dkk 1,404 million, driven mainly by 
the update of macroeconomic scenarios and single–
name exposures. the increase related mainly to the 
commercial portfolio and was driven by banking sweden 
and banking finland. 
49
credit quality 
credit quality remained strong despite the increasing 
uncertainty about the future created by the second wave 
of the coronavirus pandemic. some credit deterioration 
was observed from march in the commercial portfolio, 
while the credit quality of the personal customer 
portfolio remained stable. yet some effect on the 
personal customer portfolio is expected in the future. 
credit exposure 
credit exposure increased to dkk 807 billion from 
dkk 764 billion at the end of 2019. the increase 
was driven mostly by the personal customers and 
commercial property portfolios in sweden.
q4 2020 vs q3 2020  
lending at banking nordic increased 3%, and 
despite a decline in total income, profi t before tax 
increased 6% in the fourth quarter as a result of 
impairment reversals.
net interest income decreased 3% due to a less 
favourable interest rate environment across market 
areas, which also led to higher margin pressure on 
deposits.
net fee income decreased to dkk 323 million (q3 
2020: 438 million) due to lower income from a 
distribution agreement in banking finland. adjusted 
for this, we saw an increase in net fee income of 
10% due to good investment and lending activity.
operating expenses increased 13%, due mainly to 
restructuring as well as seasonality.
loan impairments amounted to a net reversal of 
dkk 68 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven 
mainly by an improved macroeconomic outlook, 
against a charge of dkk 364 million in the third 
quarter of 2020.
business initiatives
at banking nordic, our ambition is always to put our 
customers fi rst by offering the best experience when 
they do their day-to-day banking or seek fi nancial advice. 
as a challenger in sweden, norway and finland, we 
are working towards providing the best offerings to 
our customers, and we work diligently on supporting 
a sustainable development and on contributing to the 
societies that we are part of, to the benefi t of all of our 
stakeholders.
retail customers
better nordic retail bank
a key project at banking nordic in 2020 was the 
better nordic retail bank project. it aims to create an 
organisation in which customers will have their concerns 
and problems solved faster at the fi rst point of contact, 
experience more digital and better self-service solutions 
and get an offering that is not only competitive, but also 
tailored to their personal preferences. important steps 
were taken in 2020, and retail banking was reorganised 
to become a harmonised nordic blueprint in the third 
quarter with more specialised advisers. 
growth through partnerships
partnerships continued to be the core consumer 
strategy. in sweden, the partnership with saco/tco 
accounted for 46% of the mortgage portfolio, while 
akademikerne in norway accounted for 60%, and both 
are a core lever of growth in the markets. 
in sweden, the new agreement with hsb, sweden’s 
largest association for home savers, almost doubled the 
retail customer base from around 177,000 to 267,000. 
the migration of more than 102,000 hsb members 
and an additional 12,000 new savers generated 
sek 4.2 billion in new deposits and sek 725 million in 
investments. 
in norway, the partnership with tryg was off to a good 
start, increasing the potential for holistic advisory 
services for our customers. in addition, danica pensjon 
entered into an agreement with nito, which constitutes 
the fi rst major opportunity for full product integration 
across the various fi nancial services offered by tryg, 
danica pension and danske bank. nito is a union with 
92,000 engineers that already had a partnership with 
tryg. 
in finland, the offer to our partnership customers via the 
akava academic union and the share savers association 
was widened during the year to include equity savings 
accounts.

commercial customers
nordic mid-corp transformation
the nordic mid-corp transformation is a key project 
that focuses on our smes and mid-corp customers. it 
combines the strengths of local business knowledge 
with the benefi ts of a scalable, harmonised nordic 
organisation with shared digital platforms and a pan-
nordic it and development agenda. the transformation 
project was launched in the fi rst half of 2020. since 
then, signifi cant steps have been taken to align markets, 
roles and responsibilities. the organisational blueprint is 
now in place as is the strategy for 2023, which includes 
a harmonised service model and a digital and product 
development agenda. with the transformation, we 
aim to further increase our nordic footprint, grow the 
market share in the nordic sme and mid-corp space 
and improve customer satisfaction. the new service 
model delivers a combination of self-service solutions for 
day-to-day banking combined with customised advisory 
services that focus on supporting growth and our 
customer’s fi nancial development. 
innovation and digitalisation
throughout the year, banking nordic also improved 
products and solutions in all segments. danske mobile 
banking was further developed for our retail customers, 
and we saw a substantial improvement in the rating of 
the app. 
district is our digital platform for commercial customers, 
as mentioned in the banking dk section. in 2020, we 
added new features to district, for example ’accounts 
from other banks’. this solution enables the user to get 
an overview in district of all accounts of the business 
across banks. danske bank is the fi rst bank to be able 
to offer this in real time for the nordic countries, and 
during 2020, our subscription manager feature was 
rolled out further, allowing customers to get an overview 
of and manage their subscriptions. going forward, we 
will focus on new features and will launch several new 
solutions, which will take district from being an online 
banking solution to being a complete fi nancial platform, 
which will also enable our advisers to focus on the more 
complex tasks. 
society
as part of the group’s ambition to operate sustainably 
and have a positive impact on the societies that we are 
part of, banking nordic strengthened its position and 
took several new initiatives.
sustainability is a core element in the future business 
model of banking nordic and has therefore been a focus 
area in our transformation programmes, not least for 
the mid-corp transformation. this focus enables us to 
be part of the global sustainable agenda and support 
our customers in their future transformation. to support 
a proactive and strategic approach to sustainability, 
we have initiated relevant training for all customer-
facing colleagues working with the mid-corp segment 
within specifi c topics to integrate societal impact and 
sustainability in the dialogue with our customers, 
for example with industry-specifi c insights and esg 
assessments.
sustainability is also one of the key focus points in 
asset finance. at the end of the year, greenfleet70 was 
launched in the danish market. this is a unique concept 
with a range of solutions and products targeting large 
and medium-sized businesses. with greenfleet70, 
businesses and their employees can choose a company 
car solution that focuses on reducing co2 emissions 
and thereby contributes to a reduced climate footprint. 
in addition to a large selection of electric car models, 
greenfleet70 contains a number of tools and reports, 
including an advanced planner. 
customer satisfaction
customer satisfaction continues to be a key priority, and 
we focus on our goal of delivering the best customer 
experience by opening up the bank, building easy 
customer journeys and providing customer-centric 
solutions.
our 2023 ambition is to be in the top two on 
satisfaction among commercial and retail customers in 
all our markets. 
danske bank / annual report 2020
51
for commercial customers, we are on target in finland 
and norway, and customers are satisfi ed with our 
services and solutions, whereas we are not at the 
desired level in sweden. actions to improve customer 
satisfaction have been taken. for retail customers, we 
are challenged in all our markets. especially in retail 
norway, we are challenged by capacity constraints due 
to corona crisis-related requests.
to mitigate this, we deliver a good customer experience 
by focusing on being extra close to our customers, 
ensuring that they are fi nancially confi dent by proactively 
giving advice, through one–on-one contact as well as 
updates, webinars and podcasts for larger audiences. 
we have paid special attention to speedily meeting 
customers’ needs through tailored solutions, responding 
to the unforeseen changes in their fi nancial situation 
caused by the corona crisis.

corporates & institutions
the corona crisis signifi cantly impacted economic activity, and combined with high economic uncertainty, this created 
a challenging operating environment for our customers. we acknowledge our responsibility in helping minimise the 
negative impact of the crisis on society and focused on supporting our customers with advisory services, execution 
and liquidity, which contributed to high customer satisfaction and higher income. the investments in our capital 
markets offerings continued to yield results, and we supported customers with a large volume of transactions in both 
the primary debt and the equity markets, while affi rming our position as the leading nordic bank within sustainable 
fi nancing. profi t before loan impairment charges increased dkk 2.1 billion due to an increase in total income. profi t 
before tax was negatively impacted by increased loan impairment charges against exposures in the oil and gas industry 
and an increase in expenses due primarily to remediation and transformation costs.

*the xva acronym covers credit (cva), debit (dva), funding (fva) and collateral (colva) valuation adjustments to the fair value of the derivatives portfolio. danske 
bank has a centralised xva desk responsible for quantifying, managing and hedging xva risks. the pnl result of the xva desk is thus the combined effect of the net xva

2020 vs 2019
high customer activity
in times when the economic outlook poses a signifi cant 
challenge to businesses and the societies we are part 
of, it is essential that we are there for our customers, 
whether by assisting them in making good fi nancial 
decisions in a highly volatile operating environment, or, 
if necessary, by contributing buffer liquidity. since the 
corona crisis hit, customer demand for risk hedging, 
liquidity and capital raising has been higher than usual, 
and since march, we have increased credit facilities 
to our customers by approximately dkk 70 billion. a 
signifi cant number of these facilities remain unutilised 
and now serve as backup liquidity facilities for our 
customers. we continued to see increased customer 
and investor demand for sustainable fi nancing, and 
equity capital markets had the busiest year ever 
recorded. m&a activity in corporate finance and 
originate-to-distribute activity in loan capital markets 
was, on the other hand, adversely affected by the 
challenging market environment.
financial results
profi t before tax fell to dkk 0.8 billion, despite a 22% 
increase in total income. total income increased, driven 
primarily by higher net trading income in fi&c and higher 
net interest income in general banking. the increase 
was offset by higher loan impairment charges and 
higher operating expenses.
net interest income increased as a result of higher 
average deposit and lending volumes. 
net trading income increased signifi cantly from 
the level in 2019, as fi&c benefi ted from higher 
customer activity and improved market conditions. 
positive developments in value adjustments (xva) also 
contributed to the result. 
net fee income increased from the level in 2019, as 
the investments made in our capital markets offerings, 
in capital markets and fi&c, continued to bear fruit in 
the primary debt capital markets and the equity capital 
markets.
operating expenses increased, driven primarily 
by ongoing compliance remediation as well as the 
contribution to the danish resolution fund and the 
planned costs for the better bank transformation. direct 
staff costs fell as a result of fewer ftes and the actions 
announced in the third quarter of 2019 to restore 
profi tability in fi&c. reducing the cost base further is a 
key part of our 2023 plan to become a better bank. as 
part of the reduction plan, the full-time-equivalent staff 
number fell in the last quarter of 2020, however, the 
cost effects were limited in 2020.
fixed income & currencies 
total income in fi&c increased from the level in 
2019, driven by high customer activity, improved 
market conditions and positive developments in value 
adjustments of the derivatives portfolio (xva).
we saw substantial interest from corporate customers 
in fi nancing from capital markets, and we have been 
successful in supporting them. as a result, fee 
income from primary debt transactions increased 
from the level in 2019. secondary rates & credit 
income was challenged by the volatility and spread 
widening that followed the outbreak of the coronavirus 
pandemic in march 2020. however, from the second 
quarter onwards, income recovered as a result of a 
normalisation of market conditions, higher customer 
activity and strong performance in the credit markets. 
currencies & liquidity also benefi ted from increased 
hedging activity and more favourable market conditions.
value adjustments of the derivatives portfolio (xva) 
contributed dkk 309 million in 2020, against 
dkk -283 million in 2019. the continued normalisation 
of credit markets and danske bank’s funding spread 
led to a reversal of the negative funding valuation 
adjustment made in the fi rst quarter of 2020. during 
the year, most of the fx, interest rate and credit spread 
risk on the xva desk was hedged, thereby limiting the 
effect on the result of the volatile market movements.
capital markets 
total capital markets income was stable from the level 
in 2019. in equity capital markets, customer activity 
was extraordinarily high, whereas the challenging 
market environment led to lower trading income in 
investor solutions, lower originate-to-distribute activity 
in loan capital markets and lower m&a income despite 
good m&a activity towards the end of the year. we 
will continue to focus on our capital markets platform, 
remaining fully committed to being a leading capital 
markets provider in the nordic countries.
general banking
income from general banking activities increased as 
customers bolstered their liquidity in the wake of the 
corona crisis, leading to higher average deposit and 
lending volumes. lending volumes normalised towards 
the end of the year, as customers drew less on the 
liquidity facilities provided, whereas deposit volumes 
continued to increase.
fee income from transaction banking services was 
broadly stable, despite lower trade fi nance activity as a 
result of the disruption of global trade.
credit quality 
in 2020, loan impairments amounted to dkk 4.3 billion, 
a signifi cant increase from the level in 2019. most of 
danske bank / annual report 2020
55
the net charge was attributable to oil- and gas-related 
exposures. the initial impairments were driven by 
the rapid decline in oil prices, whereas the continued 
uncertainty in the asset-heavy offshore service and 
drilling segments led to additional impairments during 
the year, as lower activity makes restructurings diffi cult.
overall, credit quality remained strong despite continued 
uncertainty about the outlook for the oil industry and 
an increased potential second round effect from the 
coronavirus pandemic.
net credit exposure from lending activities amounted 
to dkk 541 billion at the end of december 2020, an 
increase of dkk 97 billion from the level at the end of 
2019.  most of the increase in the exposure was driven 
by loans and unutilised committed facilities to corporate 
customers and exposures to central banks. exposures to 
fi nancial institutions also increased.
q4 2020 vs q3 2020  
profi t before tax decreased, mainly as the result 
of higher loan impairment charges and higher 
operating expenses.
we continued to see good activity in primary debt 
capital markets. however, fi&c income decreased, 
driven by lower trading income from secondary 
rates & credit due partly to lower customer activity 
towards the end of the year. 
capital markets income increased signifi cantly, 
driven mainly by a seasonal increase in corporate 
finance.
general banking income was broadly stable from 
the third quarter.
operating expenses increased from the level in 
the third quarter, owing mainly to costs related 
to transformation activities as well as higher 
performance-based compensation. the number 
of full-time-equivalent staff fell, driven by the 
announcement in october to discontinue positions, 
however with limited effect on 2020 expenses.
net loan impairment charges amounted to dkk 0.6 
billion, against charges of dkk 0.4 billion in the third 
quarter of 2020. in the fourth quarter, most of the 
charges were driven by the oil and gas portfolio and, 
to some extent, exposures to the retailing segment.
business initiatives
customers
the coronavirus pandemic and the economic uncertainty 
that resulted from the spread of the virus remained the 
overarching theme throughout the year. we therefore 
dedicated our efforts to remaining very close to our 
customers, supporting them with their investment 
and risk hedging needs in the highly volatile operating 
environment, and if necessary, by contributing buffer 
liquidity. the fi rst months after the outbreak of the 
coronavirus pandemic, we saw a steep rise in corporate 
customers requesting additional short-term credit 
facilities, yet later this demand faded, and our focus 
instead switched to offering assistance with various 
capital market transactions.
equity capital markets had the busiest year ever 
recorded, and danske bank ended 2020 in second 
place in the nordic league table, measured on deal value. 
we supported customers with 54 ecm transactions in 
the course of the year, including transactions such as 
a sek 14.3 billion recapitalisation of sas, a dkk 6.2 
billion secondary placing in green energy provider Ørsted 
and a dkk 3.6 billion secondary placing in insurance 
company tryg. other notable transactions include a 
dkk 1.3 billion ipo of huscompagniet, a dkk 602 
million new issue and dual listing of boozt, an eur 88 
million ipo of biotech company nanoform, and three 
offerings for technology provider sinch totalling sek 3.6 
billion.
the market for green and sustainability-linked loans 
and green bonds continued to grow, and sustainability 
has now become an integral part of most fi nancing 
discussions. debt capital markets continued to help 
customers with bond issuance, well-diversifi ed across 
types, businesses and currencies, such as an eur 6 
billion senior unsecured bond for the federal republic 
of germany, and danske bank facilitated an increasing 
number of green transactions. examples are a joint 
bookrunner role in supporting the kingdom of sweden 
with its inaugural sek 20 billion green bond issue, and 
joint bookrunner roles in a fixed rate eur 500 million 
green bond for sbab bank and eur 500 million green 
bonds for one of finland’s largest credit institutions, 
munifin, and energy provider vattenfall, respectively.
further to this, we cemented our position as a leading 
nordic arranger of multibank loans. during the year, we 
continued to broaden our capabilities to cover the full 
spectrum across leveraged fi nance, corporate lending, 
project fi nance, infrastructure fi nance, ship fi nancing, 
real estate fi nancing and fund fi nance. in relation to 
this, our project fi nance offering took substantial steps 
forward, as illustrated by our roles in one of the largest 
green fi nancings ever, the gbp 5.5 billion project 
fi nancing for the fi rst two phases (2.4gw) of the dogger 
bank offshore wind farm, and the northvolt usd 1.6 
billion project fi nancing for the ett lithium-ion battery 
project in sweden. the two projects were named “global 
green deal of the year” and “europe industrial deal of 
the year”, respectively, by project finance international.

institutional banking strengthened its ties to our investor 
services and this resulted in deeper customer relations 
and a strong commercial momentum in the post-trade 
area across the nordic countries. danske bank now 
advises institutional customers on a broad range of 
services – from safekeeping of assets to regulatory-
driven reporting capabilities, allowing customers to focus 
on their core business. as a result, investor services 
continued to see solid growth in fee income.
in general banking, we onboarded the finnish state to 
our award-winning cash management solution, and we 
are now the state bank in denmark, sweden, finland 
and ireland. further to this, we began implementing our 
new trade finance strategy. trade finance as a line of 
industry is set to see substantial changes in the coming 
years with technology and regulation as the key drivers. 
as our customers’ preferred trade fi nance partner, 
danske bank has played a leading role in trade finance 
over the past decade, and we want to continue to do so, 
facilitating and fi nancing our customers’ business needs 
across borders also in the future.
digitalisation efforts continued
in order to support and challenge our customers to 
become more effi cient, we continued our efforts to make 
day-to-day banking easy and safe. for instance, we 
continued investing in our markets engine, optimising 
end-to-end processes and making trading more 
accessible and transparent for our customers. we 
introduced a new digital foreign exchange (fx) platform 
to provide faster, easier and more effi cient transaction 
execution for customers, and this new platform has met 
a ready audience.
in addition, new building blocks were added to district, 
danske bank’s corporate fi nancial platform, allowing 
customers to get a comprehensive, real-time overview 
of their fi nancial position, including accounts, payments 
and liquidity. one of the most notable additions to 
district towards the end of the year was functionality 
that enables customers to access solutions from other 
partners. by utilising this new feature, customers can, 
for instance, view accounts across banks in one place, 
which gives them a full fi nancial overview and enables 
them to make even better fi nancial decisions.
shaping internally to become a better bank
recent years have seen a change in the way businesses 
interact, and day-to-day banking can nowadays, to a 
large extent, be carried out across borders.
towards the end of the year, we communicated 
our decision to close down our branch in germany, 
expectedly in the fi rst half of 2022, and instead service 
affected customers via our nordic platform. the new 
setup will bring customers who today use the german 
branch closer to the nordic core and is part of our efforts 
to simplify the bank and reduce costs.
in the fourth quarter of 2020, corporates & institutions 
began its restructuring journey. with our new 
organisation that took effect across the bank in late 
january 2021, we aim to become a simpler bank, 
capable of sharing our expertise to a much wider extent, 
and with new technology and products that will enable 
us to provide high-quality advice and solutions to many 
more customers.
society
the year 2020 marked another leap forward for our 
sustainable fi nancing activities, for which we continued 
to see increasing demand, particularly in the second half 
of the year when corona crisis-related fi nancing was less 
of a focus point for our customers. hence, we helped 
a growing number of nordic corporates and investors 
develop towards a more sustainable economy, and our 
sustainable bond arranging, for example, exceeded 
the record year 2019. we will continue to expand our 
sustainability-linked platform over the years to come 
with the intention of making an impact in this fi eld and 
support our customers towards a greener and more 
sustainable future.
in 2020, we came out in fi rst place in the nordic league 
table, measured on arranging sustainability-linked loans, 
and we were ranked number one among our nordic 
peers as bookrunner for green, social and sustainable 
bonds on a global scale. by the end of 2020, we had 
come far in reaching our initial sustainable fi nancing 
target for 2023, and we look towards updating the 
target later in 2021, once we have more clarity about 
the eu taxonomy.

anti-ﬁ nancial crime initiatives
as part of our ongoing efforts to combat fi nancial 
crime, we continue to invest in our front-to-back risk 
management framework and our fi rst line of defence 
teams while working closely with our customers to help 
them understand and manage the risks that they may be 
exposed to in the course of their day-to-day business. in 
support of this, and to improve the customer experience, 
we have implemented, and continue to develop, industry-
leading solutions to keep danske bank at the forefront 
of the fi ght against fi nancial crime while also supporting 
our societal commitments.
we will continue to partner with other nordic banks 
in the development of invidem’s shared know-your-
customer (kyc) service. towards the end of the year, the 
fi rst pilot customers began testing the invidem solution. 
we expect the platform to go fully live in the course of 
2021.
employees
the coronavirus pandemic not only affected customers 
but also had substantial impact on the way in which we 
organised in 2020. thus, for the main part of the year, 
the vast majority of our 1,700 corporates & institutions 
employees were coordinating and servicing customers 
from home, yet nevertheless, we managed to drive 
customer satisfaction up, and new digital competencies 
were acquired from which we will also benefi t in the 
future.
in 2020, we ramped up our efforts to achieve a 
more diverse and inclusive workforce at corporates 
& institutions. we appointed a d&i lead and d&i 
ambassadors and launched a broad inclusion-in-action 
initiative, with participation of leaders from all levels 
of corporates & institutions and over 80 employees 
volunteering their time. the collaboration kick-started 
an initiative to help identify actions for a more inclusive 
place to work, which we will start implementing in 2021.
we will continue to follow up on our target for our first 
year analyst programme, and it is our ambition to 
achieve greater diversity, especially to have more female 
leaders than we have today. we have approved several 
process targets for recruitment, customer teams, social 
events, training and awareness to help ensure we meet 
the group’s structural targets for 2023.
customer satisfaction on upward trend
amid the corona crisis, we demonstrated our 
commitment to our customers, which translated into 
improved customer satisfaction levels in a number of the 
annual reviews conducted by prospera, the independent 
market research company in the nordic countries.
in the aggregated ranking across the nordic countries, 
we regained our strong number one position. the 
underlying country-specifi c results across all prospera 
reports that we subscribe to are a continued lead 
position in denmark and finland, third place in sweden 
and fourth place in norway.
in fi&c, we maintained our nordic lead position in fx 
and interest rates swaps, but otherwise saw a mixed 
picture with improvements in some areas and declines 
in others. 
in capital markets, we received good results in 
domestic equities and in loan agency & operations. 
on the relationship banking side, we saw positive 
developments in corporate banking sweden and 
finland, but in institutional banking, we were challenged 
in norway and sweden. 
we maintained our longstanding number one ranking 
as the preferred fi nancial provider of cash management 
and trade finance in the nordic region for the seventh 
and tenth year, respectively.

wealth management
wealth management continued to expand its product offering to include even more sustainable options. danica 
pension introduced the danica balance sustainable choice investment solution, which allows customers to invest 
pension savings with a stronger focus on sustainability, and the solution attracted investments of dkk 580 million. 
danske invest launched the danske invest global sustainable future fund, which invests in businesses playing a 
leading role in the work towards a more sustainable future. despite the highly volatile market conditions caused by 
the corona crisis, profi t before tax was stable at dkk 2.5 billion (adjusted for the gain from the sale of danica pension 
sweden and the goodwill impairment charges in 2019) and we were able to expand the product portfolio, create solid 
fund performance and provide positive returns for customers.

2020 vs 2019
customer activity
the volatility in fi nancial markets in 2020 increased 
customer demand for advice, especially during the 
market turmoil seen in february and march, which 
caused a lot of uncertainty and anxiety among 
many customers. hence, throughout 2020, wealth 
management had a strong focus on communicating 
about the corona crisis and its impact on the fi nancial 
markets to both inform and reassure customers. 
several direct messages were sent to more than 
500,000 investment customers in danske bank 
with an assessment of the situation and general 
recommendations. many customers also had the 
option of participating in webinars with our investment 
strategists held throughout the year.
customers retracted funds in the fi rst half of 2020 amid 
the volatile fi nancial markets. as markets rebounded, 
customer activity normalised. throughout 2020, there 
was keen interest in investment products with a strong 
focus on sustainability, for example the danske invest 
global sustainable future equity fund, which was 
launched in 2020.
financial results 
the profi t before tax of dkk 2.5 billion for 2020 was on 
par with that for 2019, when adjusted for the gain 
of dkk 1.3 billion from the sale of danica pension 
sweden and the goodwill impairment charge of 
dkk 0.8 billion in 2019. profi t before tax for danica 
pension decreased slightly from the level in 2019, while 
asset management’s profi t before tax increased from 
the level in 2019. 
the fi rst quarter of 2020 was signifi cantly impacted by 
the market turmoil that resulted from the corona crisis. 
financial markets saw negative returns on equities, 
and a rise in the discount curve led to low investment 
returns. in the second quarter of 2020, market 
conditions rebounded and they continued to improve in 
the third and fourth quarters of the year.
net fee income amounted to dkk 6.3 billion and was 
up 7% from the level in 2019. net fee income in danica 
pension increased from the 2019 level, largely due to 
higher risk allowance fees and an improved result in the 
health and accident business. asset management net 
fee income increased, largely as a result of record-high 
performance fees.
net trading income fell roughly dkk 360 million from 
the level in 2019, due largely to a lower investment 
result on life insurance products where danica pension 
bears the investment risk. the investment result 
includes provisions for pension yield tax in relation to the 
health and accident business and write-downs of assets 
in connection with the clean-up of accounting balances 
after the merger of danica pension and the former seb 
pension.
other income amounted to a negative dkk 79 million, 
against dkk 1.4 billion in 2019. the decrease was due 
to 2019 benefi ting from the gain of dkk 1.3 billion from 
the sale of danica pension sweden.
operating expenses decreased 4% from the level 
in 2019. in 2019, expenses were impacted by 
extraordinary costs for the integration of seb pension 
and the compensation of approximately dkk 210 million 
paid to certain customers with flexinvest fri. total 
operating expenses, excluding costs for the integration 
of seb pension and for compensation paid in connection 
with flexinvest fri, have increased, primarily because 
of costs for ongoing compliance remediation as well as 
planned costs for the better bank transformation.
premiums in danica pension amounted to dkk 30.3 
billion, against dkk 29.6 billion in 2019, when adjusted 
for the sale of danica pension sweden.
assets under management
assets under management consists of our life 
conventional business (danica traditionel), asset 
management (danica unit-linked and asset 
management) as well as assets under advice, where the 
customer makes the investment decision.
at the end of 2020, assets under management totalled 
dkk 1.8 trillion, against dkk 1.6 trillion at the end of 
2019. the increase in assets under management was 
due primarily to positive developments in the fi nancial 
markets.
net sales increased from the level in 2019. in the 
institutional segment, we saw a notable increase and 
positive net sales in 2020. as expected, the retail 
segment remained challenged in 2020 due to continued 
flexinvest fri remediation meetings, but with better-
than-expected results and a smaller net outfl ow than in 
2019.
danske bank / annual report 2020

investment return on customer funds
in 2020, the performance of wealth management funds 
was impressive, despite the market turmoil that resulted 
from the corona crisis, and we are proud to have been 
able to deliver solid returns to our customers in a very 
challenging year. 
asset management specifi cally was able to provide 
customers with strong returns. more than 74% of asset 
management investment products performed above 
benchmark in 2020, against 70% in 2019.
additionally, danica pension customers received 
positive returns across investment profi les. customers 
with danica balance mix achieved returns on 
investments between 2.8% for low-risk profi les with 0 
years to retirement and 12.2% for high-risk profi les with 
30 years to retirement. the return for customers with 
a danica balance medium risk profi le with 20 years to 
retirement was 9.5%.
q4 2020 vs q3 2020 
in the fourth quarter of 2020, profi t before tax 
increased dkk 0.5 billion to dkk 1.0 billion, due 
primarily to record-high performance fees in asset 
management. 
net fee income was up 57% from the level in the 
third quarter, due both to performance fees in asset 
management and higher income from insurance risk 
products and higher aum-correlated fees in danica 
pension. 
operating expenses increased 5% from the third 
quarter to the fourth quarter of 2020 due largely 
to costs related to our transformation activities as 
well as higher performance-based compensation, 
increased marketing costs due to higher activity 
in the fourth quarter of 2020 and increased 
consultancy expenses. 
business initiatives
society
during 2020, we made a number of improvements 
to our offerings in line with our ambition to have a 
positive impact on the societies we are part of. among 
other things, we further strengthened our sustainable 
investments offering. in recognition of our extensive 
focus on sustainability, a substantial number of 
danske invest’s funds were awarded the luxflag 
esg sustainability label – making danske invest the 
fund manager in europe with most funds bearing the 
certifi cation.
among the most important business initiatives during 
2020 were:
launch of new sustainable pension solution
with the new danica balance sustainable choice
solution, danica pension’s about 800,000 customers 
can invest their pension savings with an even stronger 
focus on sustainability. in this new investment solution, 
we select investments that actively contribute to making 
a difference in areas such as climate, environment, 
health, food production or other social aspects that 
support the un sustainable development goals. danica 
balance sustainable choice is danica pension’s next 
step in enhancing its focus on sustainable investments 
in the company’s general portfolio and a strong step 
towards its ambition of investing dkk 100 billion in the 
green transition by 2030.
better ﬁ nancial security for the self-employed
many self-employed people lack fi nancial security and 
are poorly covered in case of long-term illness and 
loss of ability to work. danica pension has joined a 
new partnership with the independent unemployment 
insurance fund ase and the non-profi t fund pension for 
selvstændige to provide better fi nancial security for the 
self-employed through insurance and pension savings. 
with this new partnership, danica pension can reach 
out to 60,000 self-employed people to provide advice 
and relevant offerings.
new initiative to reduce sickness
danica pension launched step care, which is a new 
initiative to reduce sickness absence among its 
customers and get people on long-term sick leave 
back to work. step care is a unique treatment method 
with which a personal course of treatment is prepared 
for the individual who may have a physical or mental 
disorder. depending on the symptoms, a psychologist or 
physiotherapist will continuously monitor developments 
and gradually intensify the treatment effort or involve 
other professionals if necessary – completely according 
to the personal needs of the customer.
launch of new sustainable equity fund
to further strengthen our sustainable investments 
offering, we have launched the danske invest global 
sustainable future equity fund, which invests in 
businesses leading the global transition to increased 
danske bank / annual report 2020
62
sustainability – a theme with substantial growth 
potential and attractive investment opportunities. 
the fund focuses on those businesses that are best 
positioned to address global challenges related to 
sustainability, such as climate change, overconsumption 
of the earth’s resources and the shortage of water. the 
fund has been launched across all markets for both retail 
and institutional clients.
enhanced process for norms-based investment 
restrictions
we updated our process for applying norms-based 
investment restrictions to businesses. the initiative 
supports our ambition to meet changing customer 
demands and invest customers’ assets according 
to their values and preferences while providing an 
attractive investment offering and return potential. the 
decision to apply norms-based restrictions to specifi c 
businesses is founded on a strong process, which 
includes, for example, input and research from multiple 
esg data sources, danske bank’s investment teams, 
danske bank’s sustainability position statements, 
our customers across the nordic countries, nordic 
investment institutions and other relevant stakeholders. 
as a result of the enhanced process, we have restricted 
businesses that are involved in issues related, for 
example, to climate change, biodiversity, human rights,

index funds with a sustainable layer
we launched a number of index funds aimed at retail 
investors across the nordic region to ensure a wider 
range of passively managed funds in the retail segment. 
the funds were formerly branded procapture and were 
available exclusively to institutional customers. going 
forward, the funds are branded danske invest index 
and they further cement danske invest’s position as 
the biggest danish provider of index funds for retail 
and institutional investors. our range of index funds 
differs from many other index funds by having a built-in 
sustainable layer. in all danske invest funds, actively 
as well as passively managed, the portfolio managers 
exclude investments that derive a substantial share of 
their revenue from activities that involve thermal coal, 
tar sands, controversial weapons and tobacco. the index 
funds in danske invest index that have the designation 
‘restricted’ added to the name go a step further by also 
deselecting several other investments, for example 
companies involved in activities such as weapons, 
alcohol, gambling or pornography.
employees 
during 2020, we focused increasingly on diversity 
and inclusion (d&i). several local ambassadors were 
appointed among employees at wealth management 
with the purpose of facilitating the d&i agenda and being 
local d&i spokespersons, both on behalf of the initiative 
and on behalf of the local management and colleagues. 
the ambassadors were appointed by their local senior 
management due to their infl uencer abilities and interest 
in the area.
customers 
we have a continuous focus on improving customer 
satisfaction by providing strong advice and best-in-class 
investment and pension savings products to meet 
customer needs and demands. in 2020, among other 
things, we ramped up our efforts within sustainable 
investments and launched new business initiatives 
in danica pension to increase health and fi nancial 
security among customers. these initiatives are further 
described in the ‘society’ section. our efforts are 
refl ected through improved customer satisfaction scores 
in asset management as well as danica pension.
asset management
according to prospera’s most recent survey from june 
2020, asset management in denmark remained 
ranked as number one. among all providers in the 
nordic markets, our ranking improved from number 
two to number one. in sweden, our ranking improved 
from number thirteen to number ten, and in norway, our 
ranking improved from number six to number four. in 
finland, our ranking fell from number four to number fi ve.
danica pension
according to the december 2020 aalund research 
survey on customer satisfaction, danica pension 
improved its overall ranking in denmark from number 
four to number one (shared). in norway, danica pension 
improved its ranking from number four to number two 
(shared).

northern ireland
in 2020, northern ireland, like the rest of the world, was heavily affected by the corona crisis. we took several initiatives 
to support our customers through these challenging times, and our digital solutions saw increased activity. our service 
efforts continued to be recognised, as we fi nished the year with customer satisfaction rankings of number one in 
business banking and number two in personal banking. profi t before loan impairment charges fell dkk 0.3 billion, 
despite an increase in underlying lending, refl ecting the sharply reduced uk interest rates. profi t before tax was affected 
by an increase in loan impairment charges refl ecting the uncertainty related to the corona crisis.

customer activity
the year 2020 was heavily affected by the global 
pandemic, which affected both our customers and our 
profi tability. the bank’s reputation benefi ted, however, 
from a ‘force for good’ strategy.
for personal customers, the bank ensured all branches 
and contact centres remained open throughout the 
year, and set up priority telephone numbers for elderly 
customers and healthcare workers. over 5,300 
mortgage holidays were provided to support customers, 
alongside hundreds of personal loan and credit card 
payment holidays.
for businesses, we provided more than gbp 450 
million worth of corona crisis-related business support 
loans, with more than gbp 395 million of this volume 
coming through the uk government-backed coronavirus 
business interruption loan scheme (cbils) and bounce 
back loan scheme (bbls). this assistance spanned 
around 10,000 local business funding approvals.

financial results
profi t before tax decreased to dkk 146 million for 
the full year 2020 (2019: dkk 789 million), driven 
primarily by higher loan impairments and lower income.
total income amounted to dkk 1,736 million (2019: 
dkk 2,011 million). net interest income was affected 
by the sharp decline in uk interest rates from late 
march. underlying lending (excluding the public sector) 
and deposits both increased year-on-year. lending 
includes uk government-guaranteed corona crisis-
related business support loans, while the increase 
in deposits refl ected additional liquidity being held by 
both business and personal customers. non-interest 
income decreased as a result of very low activity levels, 
particularly in the second quarter, due to corona crisis-
related lockdown measures.
at dkk 1,212 million, operating expenses were broadly 
maintained, as local cost reduction initiatives were 
offset by costs related to the better bank initiatives and 
regulatory compliance.
credit quality
loan impairment charges increased, refl ecting the 
weaker uk economic outlook with impairment charges 
for potential future loan losses in sectors heavily 
impacted by the corona crisis.
q4 2020 vs q3 2020  
total income amounted to dkk 400 million (q3: 
dkk 414 million) despite the challenging conditions 
caused by the corona crisis. the decrease in in-
come was partly offset by a slight decrease in 
expenses. hence, profi t before loan impairment 
charges fell to dkk 93 million (q3: dkk 103 
million). profi t before tax amounted to dkk 10 
million (q3: dkk 60 million) and was affected by 
increasing loan impairment charges due to the 
corona crisis.
while we have seen improvement since the second 
quarter of the year, activity levels continue to be 
affected by renewed local coronavirus measures.
business initiatives
our vision is to be recognised as the best bank for 
customers, colleagues, partners and society. in a 
challenging environment, we continued to execute our 
strategy to digitally transform the bank, improve the 
customer experience and reduce costs.
a highlight of the ‘force for good’ strategy saw the bank 
set up a ‘check in and chat’ service with colleagues 
volunteering to call elderly customers to check in on 
their general well-being, have a chat and ask if there is 
any way we as a the bank can help. more than 14,000 
telephone calls were made in 2020, with around 600 
referrals issued to third-party support agencies that we 
believed could also help these customers with guidance.
the corona crisis also affected the digital space, and in 
2020, we saw more than 5 million digital logons from 
customers per month and there was a 32% increase in 
digital transactions year-on-year.
it was also a year in which our progress on the diversity 
agenda was formally recognised with a silver diversity 
charter mark. danske bank is the only bank in northern 
ireland to have reached this level of accreditation and 
one of only two companies awarded it across all sectors. 
in northern ireland, we have also achieved a 50:50 
gender split in senior roles across the organisation.
on the green agenda, the bank was delighted to be 
accredited at platinum level in the annual northern 
ireland environmental benchmarking survey carried out 
by business in the community. the result showcased 
danske bank as the highest-ranked bank in the country 
when it comes to environmental responsibility.
customer satisfaction
we were pleased to fi nish the year in fi rst place in 
corporate & business banking and in second place in 
personal banking.

non-core
the winding-up of non-core portfolios is proceeding according to plan. profi t before tax for 2020 was a negative 
dkk 596 million. total lending stood at dkk 3.1 billion at the end of 2020, against dkk 7.5 billion at the end of 2019 
due to the sale of loan portfolios in the baltics, which led to lower capital requirements for the group.

2020 vs 2019
the non-core unit posted a loss before tax of dkk 596 
million, against a loss before tax of dkk 493 million 
in 2019, due mainly to losses related to the fi nal exit 
from estonia, which affected total income and operating 
expenses. further, operating expenses for 2019 
benefi ted from an adjustment of vat regarding previous 
years.
net credit exposure totalled dkk 4.1 billion, against 
dkk 10.4 billion at the end of 2019. 
at the end of 2020, total lending amounted to 
dkk 3.1 billion. the group has exited its banking 
activities in estonia, russia, and latvia. the danske 
bank russia legal entity was deregistered in december 
2020, and we have thus terminated our activities in 
russia. at the lithuanian branch, the only portfolio 
remaining is a small portfolio of commercial loans that 
are actively managed down. the sale of the baltic loan 
portfolios has been the primary driver of the reduction of 
total lending in non-core to less than half the amount at 
the end of december 2019, and this led to lower capital 
requirements for the group.
the non-core conduits portfolio amounted to dkk 2.7 
billion, against dkk 3.9 billion at the end of 2019. the 
portfolio consists mainly of liquidity facilities for conduits.
total impairments amounted to a net charge of dkk 88 
million, against dkk 213 million in 2019. the decrease 
was due primarily to the sale of the baltic loan portfolios 
and a single-name exposure in a legacy non-core 
portfolio.
q4 2020 vs q3 2020  
profi t before tax amounted to a loss of dkk 113 
million, against a loss of dkk 37 million in the third 
quarter of 2020. 
the increase in loss before tax in the fourth quarter 
was due mainly to losses related to the sale of baltic 
portfolios, which affected total income and loan 
impairment charges. further, there was a one-off 
provision for legacy issues in ireland, which affected 
operating expenses.

other activities
other activities includes group treasury and group support functions as well as eliminations. net interest income 
primarily refl ects differences at the internal bank between actual and allocated funding costs using the group’s funds 
transfer pricing model, the elimination of the interest expense on equity accounted additional tier 1 capital, reported as 
an interest expense in the business segments, as well as income related to the group’s liquidity portfolio.

2020 vs 2019
other activities posted a loss before tax of dkk 2,712 
million, against a loss before tax of dkk 1,491 million in 
2019.
net interest income amounted to a loss of dkk 260 
million, against a loss of dkk 5 million in 2019. the 
decrease was caused primarily by a decline in income 
from allocated liquidity costs that were affected by 
higher deposit volumes. this effect was partly offset by 
an increase in income from structural changes to the 
group’s funding and liquidity management.
net trading income amounted to dkk 136 million, 
against dkk 1,421 million in 2019. the decrease was 
due mainly to the fact that 2019 benefi ted from the 
gain from the sale of the shareholding in lr realkredit 
and from other positive market value adjustments of the 
private equity portfolio. 
operating expenses amounted to dkk 1,816 million, 
against dkk 2,548 million in 2019. the decrease in 
2020 was due mainly to a net reversal of provisions 
for operational risk-related losses, which was made in 
2019, thus also affecting the 2019 expense level.
q4 2020 vs q3 2020  
other activities posted a loss before tax of dkk 976 
million, against a loss before tax of dkk 342 million 
in the third quarter of 2020.
net interest income amounted to a loss of dkk 54 
million, against dkk 157 million in the third quarter 
of 2020. the increase in quarterly income was 
driven primarily by the internal bank where allocated 
liquidity costs increased following a number of 
corrective actions to reduce deposit compensation 
to the business units. income at the internal bank 
from managing short-term liquidity was also lower in 
the fourth quarter.
net trading income amounted to dkk 134 million, 
against dkk 104 million in the third quarter of 
2020, due mainly to value adjustments of own 
bonds.
operating expenses amounted to dkk 541 million, 
against dkk 261 million in the third quarter 
of 2020. the increase was due primarily to 
transformation work, including restructuring costs.

deﬁ nition of alternative 
performance measures
danske bank’s management believes that the alternative performance measures (apms) used in the management’s report provide valuable information 
to readers of the fi nancial statements. the apms provide a more consistent basis for comparing the results of fi nancial periods and for assessing the 
performance of the group and each individual business unit. they are also an important aspect of the way in which danske bank’s management defi nes 
operating targets and monitors performance. 
throughout the management’s report, performance is assessed on the basis of the fi nancial highlights and segment reporting, which represent the 
fi nancial information regularly provided to management. the differences between the fi nancial highlights and the ifrs fi nancial statements relate to certain 
changes in the presentation. net profi t is the same in the fi nancial highlights and in the ifrs income statement. note g3 to the fi nancial statements 
describes the differences between the fi nancial highlights and the ifrs fi nancial statements, and each line item in the fi nancial highlights is reconciled with 
the consolidated fi nancial statements prepared under ifrs.
defi nitions of additional ratios presented on page 6 and in other sections of the management’s report:
ratios and key ﬁ gures
deﬁ nition
dividend per share (dkk) 
the dividend per share proposed in the annual report and paid to shareholders in the subsequent year. accordingly, 
for 2020, it is the dividend to be paid in 2021. for 2019, no dividend was paid in 2020. further information can be 
found in note g1(a).
return on average 
shareholders’ equity (% p.a.)
net profi t as disclosed in the fi nancial highlights divided by the average of the quarterly average shareholders’ equity 
(beginning and end of each quarter) within the year. net profi t and shareholders’ equity are stated as if the equi-
ty-accounted additional tier 1 capital was classifi ed as a liability. in the numerator, net profi t is reduced by interest 
expenses of dkk 551 million (2019: dkk 786 million). the denominator represents equity, excluding additional tier 
1 capital and other non-controlling interests equal to a reduction in the average of the quarterly average of equity of 
dkk 13,526 million (2019: 17,744 million) compared to a simple average of total equity (beginning and the end of 
the period).
net interest income as % p.a. of 
loans and deposits
net interest income in the fi nancial highlights divided by the daily average of the sum of loans and deposits. if the 
ratio was calculated applying the sum of loans and deposits end of period, the ratio for 2020 would be 0.72% (2019: 
0.79%) due to the daily average of the sum of loans and deposits being dkk 124.8 billion (2019: dkk 54.9 billion) 
lower than calculating the ratio by applying the end-of-period sum of loans and deposits. the purpose of the ratio is to 
show if the growth in net interest income follows the growth in loans and deposits. the daily average is a more faithful 
representation of the growth in loans and deposits.
cost/income ratio (c/i), (%)
operating expenses, impairment charges on goodwill and impairment charges other intangible assets divided by total 
income. all amounts are from the fi nancial highlights.
c/i, excluding impairment on 
intangible assets (%)
operating expenses divided by total income. all amounts are from the fi nancial highlights.
book value per share
shareholders’ equity (that is, excluding equity-accounted additional tier 1 capital) divided by the number of shares 
outstanding at the end of the period.
loan impairment charges as % 
of net credit exposure
this ratio is calculated on the basis of loan impairment charges and loans and guarantees in core segments. the nu-
merator is the loan impairment charges of dkk 7,001 million (2019: dkk 1,516 million) from the fi nancial highlights 
and annualised. the denominator is the sum of loans at amortised cost of dkk 1,022.3 billion (2019: dkk 972.1 
billion), loans at fair value of dkk 802.6 billion (2019: dkk 794.9 billion) and guarantees of dkk 68.7 billion (2019: 
dkk 83.1 billion) at the beginning of the year, as disclosed in the column “lending activities – core” in the “breakdown 
of credit exposure” table in the notes to the fi nancial statements. the ratio is calculated for each business unit. 
allowance account as % of net 
credit exposure
this ratio is calculated on the basis of the allowance account and loans and guarantees in core segments. the 
numerator is the allowance account of dkk 22.6 billion (2019: dkk 20.5 billion) at the end of the period, as 
disclosed in the “allowance account in core activities broken down by segment” table in the notes to the fi nancial 
statements. the denominator is the sum of loans at amortised cost of dkk 1,022.7 billion, loans at fair value of 
dkk 816.3 billion, and guarantees of dkk 71.7 billion, at the end of the period, as disclosed in the column “lending 
activities – core” in the “breakdown of credit exposure” table in the notes to the fi nancial statements. the ratio is 
calculated for each business unit. 
realkredit danmark bonds 
funding loans
on page 25, information is provided on the funding of lending by deposits and covered bonds. the ‘bonds issued 
by realkredit danmark’ line item equals the carrying amount in the balance sheet, that is, issued bonds held by the 
group’s external investors. the ‘total realkredit danmark bonds’ line item equals loans funded by realkredit danmark 
bonds. the ‘own holdings of bonds’ line item is a residual item that includes the net amount of the elimination of own 
holdings less issued bonds backed by collateral other than mortgage loans, such as securities. 
market shares of lending and 
deposits
market shares are based on data from central banks at the time of reporting. comparative information is updated on 
the basis of the latest available data, for example annual report 2019 included november 2019 data for finland, 
sweden and norway as december 2019 data was not available at the time of publication of annual report 2019. 
subsequently, in interim report – fi rst quarter 2020, the comparative data for market shares in finland, sweden and 
norway was updated with december 2019 data.

notes – danske bank group 
g1. basis of preparation 
 
(a) general 
danske bank group prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the international financial reporting standards (ifrss) and 
applicable interpretations (ifric) issued by the international accounting standards board (iasb), as adopted by the eu. furthermore, the consolidated 
financial statements comply with the danish fsa’s executive order no. 1306 dated 16 december 2008 on the use of ifrss by undertakings subject to 
the danish financial business act.  
 
as announced on 20 april 2020 and in light of the economic situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the board of directors decided to propose 
to the general meeting that no dividends be paid for 2019. the impact from the change to proposed dividends was recognised in interim report – first 
quarter of 2020 as a reversal in the first quarter of 2020. on 15 may 2020, the group published the document ‘supplement to annual report 2019’ 
illustrating the impact on the annual report 2019 on a condensed basis. the annual report 2019 and the changed proposal for allocation of dividends 
were approved by the general meeting on 9 june 2020. 
 
on 1 january 2020, the group implemented the amendments to ias 1 and ias 8 (definition of material), ifrs 3, business combinations (definition of a 
business) and amendments to references to the conceptual framework in ifrs standards. the implementation of the amendments had no impact on the 
group’s financial statements. further information on the changes to accounting policies in 2020 can be found in note g2. except for these changes, the 
group has not changed its significant accounting policies from those applied in annual report 2019.  
 
for changes in the segment reporting, see note g3. 
 
financial statement figures are stated in danish kroner and whole millions, unless otherwise stated. as a result, rounding discrepancies may occur 
because totals have been rounded off and the underlying decimals are not presented to financial statement users. 
 
monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. exchange rate adjustments of monetary 
assets and liabilities arising as a result of differences in the exchange rates at the transaction date and at the balance sheet date are recognised in the 
income statement. non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency that are subsequently revalued at fair value are translated at the exchange 
rates at the date of revaluation. exchange rate adjustments are included in the fair value adjustment of an asset or liability. other non-monetary items in 
foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates at the transaction date. the accounting treatment of foreign currency translation of units outside 
denmark is described in note g25. 
 
for the purpose of clarity, the primary financial statements and the notes to the financial statements are prepared using the concepts of materiality and 
relevance. this means that line items not considered material in terms of quantitative and qualitative measures or relevant to financial statement users 
are aggregated and presented together with other items in the primary financial statements. similarly, information not considered material is not 
presented in the notes. 
 
the significant accounting policies are incorporated into the notes to which they relate. 
 
(b) significant accounting estimates and judgements 
the preparation of financial information requires, in some cases, the use of judgements and estimates by management. this includes judgements made 
when applying accounting policies. the most significant judgements made when applying accounting policies relate to the classification of financial assets 
and financial liabilities under ifrs 9, especially related to the business model assessment, and the sppi test (further explained in note g15) and the 
designation of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch (further explained in note 
g16). an overview of the classification and measurement basis for financial instruments can be found in section (c) of this note. 
 
further, the determination of the carrying amounts of some assets and liabilities requires the estimation of the effects of uncertain future events on 
those assets and liabilities. the estimates are based on premises that management finds reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and 
unpredictable. the premises may be incomplete, unexpected future events or situations may occur, and other parties may arrive at other estimated 
values. in view of the inherent uncertainties and the high level of subjectivity and judgement involved in the recognition and measurement of the items 
listed below, it is possible that the outcomes in the next financial year could differ from those on which management’s estimates are based.  
 
measurement of expected credit losses on loans, financial guarantees and loan commitments, and bonds measured at amortised cost or fair value 
through other comprehensive income 
the three-stage expected credit loss impairment model in ifrs 9 depends on whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition. 
if the credit risk has not increased significantly, the impairment charge equals the expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible 
within the next 12 months (stage 1). if the credit risk has increased significantly, the loan is more than 30 days past due, or the loan is in default or 
otherwise impaired, the impairment charge equals the lifetime expected credit losses (stages 2 and 3). in determining the impairment for expected credit 
losses, management exercises judgement and uses estimates and assumptions as explained below.

those assets and liabilities. the estimates are based on premises that management finds reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and 
unpredictable. the premises may be incomplete, unexpected future events or situations may occur, and other parties may arrive at other estimated 
values. in view of the inherent uncertainties and the high level of subjectivity and judgement involved in the recognition and measurement of the items 
listed below, it is possible that the outcomes in the next financial year could differ from those on which management’s estimates are based.  
 
measurement of expected credit losses on loans, financial guarantees and loan commitments, and bonds measured at amortised cost or fair value 
through other comprehensive income 
the three-stage expected credit loss impairment model in ifrs 9 depends on whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition. 
if the credit risk has not increased significantly, the impairment charge equals the expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible 
within the next 12 months (stage 1). if the credit risk has increased significantly, the loan is more than 30 days past due, or the loan is in default or 
otherwise impaired, the impairment charge equals the lifetime expected credit losses (stages 2 and 3). in determining the impairment for expected credit 
losses, management exercises judgement and uses estimates and assumptions as explained below.

(b) significant accounting estimates and judgements 
the expected credit loss is calculated for all individual facilities as a function of probability of default (pd), exposure at default (ead) and loss given default 
(lgd) and incorporates forward-looking information. the estimation of expected credit losses involves forecasting future economic conditions over a 
number of years. such forecasts are subject to management judgement and those judgements may be sources of measurement uncertainty that have 
significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to a carrying amount in future periods. the incorporation of forward-looking elements reflects the 
expectations of the group’s senior management and involves the creation of scenarios (base case, upside and downside), including an assessment of the 
probability for each scenario. the purpose of using multiple scenarios is to model the non-linear impact of assumptions about macroeconomic factors on 
the expected credit losses. see further in the section below on the impact from the corona crises on the macroeconomic scenarios used. 
 
due to the corona crisis, the macroeconomic scenarios were revised during 2020, see further in the separate section below.  
 
with the new suite of scenarios, the base case scenario enters with a probability of 60% (2019: 60%), the upside scenario with a probability of 15% 
(2019: 10%) and the downside scenario with a probability of 25% (2019: 30%). on the basis of these assessments, the allowance account at the end of 
2020 amounted to dkk 23.3 billion (2019: dkk 21.3 billion). if the base case scenario was assigned a probability of 100%, the allowance account would 
decrease dkk 0.4 billion (2019: 0.7 billion). compared to the base case scenario, the allowance account would increase dkk 1.7 billion (2019: dkk 2.4 
billion), if the downside scenario was assigned a probability of 100%. the increase reflects primarily the transfer of exposures from stage 1 to stage 2 
and increased expected credit losses within stage 2. if instead the upside scenario was assigned a probability of 100 %, the allowance account would 
decrease dkk 0.4 billion (2019: dkk 0.5 billion) compared to the base case scenario. it shall be noted that the expected credit losses in the individual 
scenarios does not represent expected credit loss (ecl) forecasts. 
 
in determining the expected credit losses, management is required to exercise judgement in defining what is considered a significant increase in credit 
risk. according to the group’s definition of a significant increase in credit risk, i.e. when a loan is transferred from stage 1 to stage 2, facilities with an 
initial pd below 1% are transferred to stage 2 if the facility’s 12-month pd has increased by at least 0.5 of a percentage point and the facility’s lifetime 
pd has doubled since origination. the allowance account is relatively stable in terms of changes to the definition of significant increase in credit risk. at 
the end of 2020, the allowance account would increase by dkk 0.03 billion (2019: dkk 0.03 billion), if instead an increase in the facility’s 12-month pd 
by at least 0.25 of a percentage point combined with a doubling of the lifetime pd was considered a significant increase in credit risk. 
 
management applies judgement when determining the need for post-model adjustments. at the end of 2020, the post-model adjustments amounted to 
dkk 6.4 billion (2019: dkk 4.0 billion) and continue to include the immediate risks arising from the corona crises that were introduced in the first quarter 
of 2020, see further in the separate section below. on the types of risks covered by post-model adjustments, more information can be found in the risk 
management notes. further information on the allocation of post-model adjustment to the underlying exposures can be found in the section ‘classification 
of customers’ in the risk management notes. 
 
loan impairment charges for 2020 amounted to dkk 7.089 million (2019: dkk 1,729 million). impairments were driven primarily by the update of the 
macroeconomic scenarios as a result of the corona crisis and credit deterioration for selected customers, largely within the oil and gas exposure due to 
the continued uncertainty within the offshore segment.  
 
accounting treatment of the impacts on expected credit losses from the corona crisis  
the effect of the coronavirus pandemic began to affect the group’s credit portfolio in the first quarter of 2020. further credit deterioration remains to 
be seen, as the effect is currently limited and mitigated by the continued government support packages. based on the measures taken by governments 
across the world and in the group’s market areas to contain the virus, economies are seeing lower activity in the short term, although especially in the 
nordic economies, the activity in many sectors was back to a normal activity level already in the second quarter of 2020 after the reopening of societies. 
however, in the fourth quarter of 2020 a second wave of the corona pandemic evolved and new lock-downs were introduced. the economies continue to 
be supported by government support packages. significant uncertainty still remains as to the effectiveness of actions taken by governments to contain 
the virus and as to when the roll-out of vaccine programmes will have a sufficient coverage to limit the spread of the virus. the economic activity is likely 
to be impacted in the shorter term and it is yet unknown to which extent governments will continue to support the economies. 
 
for most of the group’s credit portfolio, the negative impact on individual customers of the corona crisis is expected to materialise over the coming 
quarters. customer assessments were made on an ongoing basis since the second quarter of 2020, and impairments were revisited in light of the 
changed outlook. while customer activity in 2020 was higher than usual, portfolio impact still awaiting as customers are still assessing the 
consequences. as a result, the financial consequences still remain to be seen when, for instance, government support comes to an end and as the 
pandemic evolves.

(b) significant accounting estimates and judgements 
the group’s forbearance practices have been updated to pay particular attention to customers affected by the corona crisis. this includes additional 
guidance to ensure that concessions due to the corona crisis are considered forbearance only if they relate to customers that are not deemed 
creditworthy combined with the customer’s long-term financial position being further weakened by the outbreak. for the majority of the credit portfolio, 
short-term concessions to otherwise creditworthy customers are not considered forbearance. in practice, this means that short-term concessions to 
customers in rating categories 1 to 5 are not considered a forbearance measure when taking the ongoing customer assessments into account. for 
customers in rating categories 6 and 7, an individual assessment of the customer’s financial strength is made, whereas concessions to lower-rated 
customers are considered forbearance.  
 
a large part of the impact on expected credit losses resulting from the corona crisis relates to changes to forward-looking information, with the 
macroeconomic scenarios applied being significantly different from those applied in 2019. the group’s base case scenario is based on the nordic outlook 
from october and reflects a significant decline in economic activity in 2020 followed by a recovery in 2021. the downside scenario has been updated to 
a w-shaped trend, where the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic causes lock-downs in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. 
the base case scenario is considered the most likely scenario with a likelihood of 60%, while the downside scenario has a likelihood of 25%. further 
information on the macroeconomic scenarios used can be found in the section ‘macroeconomic scenarios’ in the risk management notes. during all 
quarters of 2020, the base case macroeconomic scenarios used reflected a recovery in 2021. therefore, the forward-looking information used during 
the quarters of 2020 gradually became more positive when the period until recovery in 2021 shortened, leading to reversal of the modelled expected 
credit losses in all main industries in the second half of 2020. due to the continued significant uncertainty related to the magnitude of the pandemic and 
to the extent to which governments will continue to support the economies, management deemed it appropriate to increase the post-model adjustment 
related to the corona crisis during the second half of 2020. 
 
the corona crisis-related post-model adjustments relate to industries directly affected by the corona crisis and for which the macroeconomic scenarios 
themselves do not lead to a sufficient increase in expected credit losses. this includes expected, but not yet materialised, credit deterioration in relation 
to the personal customers and commercial property industries in denmark as government support ends. this also includes retailing, hotels and 
restaurants (within the hotels, restaurants and leisure industry) as well as oil and gas (within the shipping, oil and gas industry). the targeted post-model 
adjustment related to such sectors amounts to dkk 2.0 billion.  
 
except as described above, all other policies and principles remain in place. staging criteria are unchanged, including the 30 days past due criteria and 
pd-based criteria for transfer to stage 2. staging transfers will largely be reflected in the coming months as specific information on customers becomes 
available. 
 
note g15 and the section on credit risk in the risk management notes provide more details on expected credit losses. at the end of 2020, financial assets 
covered by the expected credit loss model accounted for about 52% of total assets (2019: 57%). 
 
fair value measurement of financial instruments 
at the end of 2020, no unusual challenges in obtaining reliable pricing apart from insignificant parts of the portfolio remained. the majority of valuation 
techniques continues to employ only observable market data, and there has been no significant increase in financial instruments measured on the basis 
of valuation techniques that are based on one or more significant unobservable inputs. the latter continues to include only unlisted shares, certain bonds 
and some long-dated derivatives for which there is no active market. on the derivatives portfolio, the group makes fair value adjustments to cover changes 
in counterparty risk (cva and dva) and to cover expected funding costs (fva and colva) on derivatives, bid-offer spreads on the net open position of the 
portfolio of assets and liabilities with offsetting market risk recognised at mid-market prices, and model risk on level 3 derivatives. at 31 december 
2020, the adjustments totalled dkk 1.6 billion (2019: dkk 1.5 billion), including the adjustment for credit risk on derivatives that are credit impaired. . 
note g33(a) provides more details on the fair value measurement of financial instruments. 
 
the group uses derivatives to hedge the fixed interest rate on some financial assets and liabilities, thus converting the fixed interest rates on the financial 
instruments to variable interest rates by the use of swaps. the ongoing interest rate benchmark reform will replace existing benchmark interbank 
offered rates (ibors) with alternative risk-free rates. there is currently uncertainty as to the timing and the methods of transition of different ibors and 
whether some existing benchmarks will continue to be supported. as a result of these developments, accounting judgement is involved in determining 
whether certain hedge accounting relationships that hedge the interest rate risk due to changes in ibors continue to qualify for hedge accounting. eur 
and usd denominated swaps cleared on a ccp have been converted to estr and sofr discounting respectively, and the conversion had no significant 
impact on the group’s hedge accounting values. following iasb’s project ‘interest rate benchmark reform, phase i’ for the assessment of effectiveness 
of such hedges, it is assumed that the interest rate benchmark is not altered as a result of the reform. for further information, see note g12(d).

measurement of goodwill and customer rights  
goodwill is tested for impairment once a year or more frequently if indications of impairment exist. impairment testing requires management to estimate 
the present value of future cash flows. a number of factors affect the value of such cash flows, including discount rates, changes in the economic outlook, 
customer behaviour and competition. at 31 december 2020, goodwill amounted to dkk 6.1 billion (2019: dkk 6.2 billion).  
 
despite the corona crises, the impairment test conducted in 2020 did not reveal any impairment loss. the impairment test conducted in 2019 revealed 
a total impairment loss of dkk 1.6 billion in fi&c and capital markets at corporates & institutions and in danica pension at wealth management, leaving 
no excess value for those units at the end of 2019. 
 
the goodwill in fi&c and capital markets of dkk 2.1 billion (2019: dkk 2.1 billion) is highly sensitive to changes in allocated capital, growth in the 
terminal period and the discount rate. the goodwill in danica pension of dkk 1.6 billion (2019: dkk 1.6 billion) is highly sensitive to changes in solvency 
capital requirements, growth in the terminal period and the discount rate.  
 
the remaining goodwill mainly consists of dkk 1.8 billion (2019: dkk 1.8 billion) in danske capital at wealth management and dkk 0.5 billion (2019: 
dkk 0.5 billion) in general banking at corporates & institutions, both showing significant amounts of excess value in the impairment tests in 2020 and 
2019, although the expected future cash flows of danske capital are negatively impacted by the expectation of lower fee income in 2020 triggered by a 
decline in asset under management, and the expected future cash flows of general banking are negatively impacted by the expectation of lower income 
and higher loan impairment charges caused by the corona crisis. 
 
note g19 provides more information about the impairment test in 2020 and 2019 including sensitivity to changes in assumptions. 
 
measurement of liabilities under insurance contracts 
liabilities under insurance contracts are measured at the present value of expected benefits for each insurance contract. the measurement is based on 
actuarial computations that rely on estimates of a number of variables, including mortality and disability rates, and on the discount rate. the future 
mortality rates are based on the danish fsa’s benchmark, while other variables are estimated based on data from the group’s own portfolio of insurance 
contracts. section (c) of this note and note g18 provide further information on the measurement of insurance liabilities. the risk management notes 
contain a sensitivity analysis for life insurance.

financial instruments account for around 98% of total assets and liabilities. a portion of financial assets relate to investments made under insurance 
contracts. the following sections provide a general description of the classification and measurement of financial instruments and obligations under 
insurance contracts. 
 
financial instruments – general 
the group recognises financial assets and liabilities when it becomes a party to the terms of the contract. a financial asset, or a portion of a financial 
asset, is derecognised if the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or have been transferred, usually by sale, leading to substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset or significant risks and rewards being transferred. financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability has been 
settled, has expired or has been extinguished. 
 
regular way purchases and sales of financial instruments are recognised and derecognised at the settlement date. fair value adjustments of unsettled 
financial instruments are recognised from the trade date to the settlement date if the financial asset is classified at fair value through profit or loss or 
through other comprehensive income. the classification is shown in the table below.

(c) 
overview of classification and measurement basis for financial instruments and insurance contracts 
classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities – general 
financial assets are classified on the basis of the business model adopted for managing the assets and on their contractual cash flow characteristics 
(including embedded derivatives, if any) are grouped into one of the following measurement categories:  
• 
amortised cost (amc) 
• 
fair value through other comprehensive income (fvoci) 
• 
fair value through profit or loss (fvpl) 
 
financial assets are measured at amc if they are held within a business model for the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows (hold to collect) and 
if cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.  
 
financial assets are measured at fvoci if they are held within a business model for the purpose of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
(hold to collect and sell) and if cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. fvoci results in the assets 
being recognised at fair value in the balance sheet and at amc in the income statement. gains and losses, except for expected credit losses and foreign 
exchanges gains and losses, are therefore recognised in other comprehensive income until the financial asset is derecognised. when the financial asset 
is derecognised the cumulative gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement.  
 
all other financial assets are mandatorily measured at fvpl including financial assets held within other business models, such as financial assets 
managed at fair value or held for trading and financial assets with contractual cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.  
 
generally, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost and when relevant with bifurcation of embedded derivatives not closely related to the host 
contract. financial liabilities measured at fair value comprise the trading portfolio (derivatives and obligations to repurchase securities) and liabilities 
designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option. value adjustments relating to the inherent credit risk of financial liabilities 
designated at fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income unless this leads to an accounting mismatch. 
 
the business model assessment  
the business model assessment in danske bank group has been applied separately for each business unit represented by the group’s reportable 
segments, and it is based on observable factors for the different portfolios, such as (1) how the performance of the business model and the financial 
assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the executive board and the board of directors, (2) the risks that affect the 
performance of the business model and the way such risks are managed and (3) past and expected frequency, value and timing of sales from the portfolio. 
in general, the business model assessment of the group can be summarised as follows: 
 
• 
the group’s banking units, comprising banking dk, banking nordic, general banking at c&i and northern ireland, have a “hold to collect” business 
model. the financial assets consist primarily of loans. the management and reporting of performance are based on collecting the contractual cash 
flows, and loans are only very infrequently sold. 
• 
the trading units at c&i (fi&c and capital markets) and the financial assets related to the group’s insurance activities have a business model that 
is neither “hold to collect” nor “hold to collect and sell” and the financial assets are mandatorily recognised at fvpl. the assets consist of bonds, 
shares, repo transactions and short-term loans. some of the financial assets are included in portfolios with a trading pattern that falls under the 
definition of “held for trading” while other portfolios are managed and their performance reported on a fair value basis. 
• 
group treasury has portfolios of bonds within the “hold to collect” business model, the “hold to collect and sell” business models and the “other” 
business model.  
• 
the remaining portfolio of non-core is “hold to collect”. the financial assets consist primarily of loans.

overview of classification and measurement basis for financial instruments and insurance contracts 
the sppi test (solely payment of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding)  
the second step in the classification of the financial assets in portfolios being “hold to collect” and “hold to collect and sell” relates to the assessment of 
whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with the sppi test. the principal amount reflects the fair value at initial recognition less any subsequent 
changes, e.g. due to repayment. the interest must represent only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and a 
margin consistent with basic lending features. if the cash flows introduce more than de minimis exposure to risk or volatility that is not consistent with 
basic lending features, the financial asset is mandatorily recognised at fvpl.  
 
in general, the group’s portfolios of financial assets that are “hold to collect” or “hold to collect and sell” (loans and bonds) have contractual cash flows 
that are consistent with the sppi test, i.e. they have basic lending features. 
 
however, loans granted under danish mortgage finance law are funded by issuing listed mortgage bonds with matching terms. such loans are granted 
by the realkredit danmark subsidiary only. borrowers may repay such loans by delivering the underlying bonds. this represents an option to prepay at 
fair value that can be both above and below the principal amount plus accrued interest. changes in the fair value of the underlying bonds include other 
elements than the effect of changes in the relevant benchmark interest rate and the prepayment option is therefore not consistent with the sppi test in 
ifrs 9 and are mandatorily measured at fvpl. 
 
all equity instruments have contractual cash flows that do not pass the sppi test. all such holdings are recognised at fvpl since the group has decided 
not to use the option to designate equity instruments at fvoci. 
 
financial liabilities  
financial liabilities are generally measured at amortised cost and when relevant with bifurcation of embedded derivatives not closely related to the host 
contract. financial liabilities measured at fair value comprise derivatives, the trading portfolio and liabilities designated at fvpl under the fair value 
option. value adjustments relating to the inherent own credit risk of financial liabilities designated at fair value are, however, recognised in other 
comprehensive income unless this leads to an accounting mismatch.  
 
ifrs 9 allows the designation of financial liabilities at fvpl when doing so results in more relevant information, because either (1) it eliminates or 
significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise, or (2) is part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed and their 
performance reported on a fair value basis to management.  
 
the group designates the following financial liabilities at fvpl: 
• 
mortgage bonds issued by realkredit danmark. the bonds fund the loans granted by realkredit danmark, i.e. loans that due to the sppi test are 
mandatorily recognised at fvpl. the fair value of the loans is based on the fair value of the issued bonds (the loans and the issued bonds that are 
funding the loans have matching contractual terms) adjusted for changes in the fair value of the credit risk of borrowers. to eliminate the accounting 
mismatch that exists if the loans are measured at fvpl and the issued bonds at amc, the issued bonds are designated at fvpl, and fair value 
changes of the issued bonds (including fair value changes related to own credit risk) are offset by the fair value changes of the loans. hence, changes 
in the fair value attributable to the group’s own credit risk on the issued bonds are also recognised in the income statement since an accounting 
mismatch would otherwise arise. 
• 
financial liabilities in fi&c and capital markets at c&i. these financial liabilities are part of a portfolio of financial assets and liabilities that is 
managed and performance reported to the management on a fair value basis. the financial liabilities consist of repo transactions, deposits and 
commercial papers. changes, if any, in the fair value attributable to the group’s own credit risk is, however, recognised in other comprehensive 
income.  
  
hedge accounting 
the group uses derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk on some fixed-rate assets and fixed-rate liabilities measured at amortised cost and on some 
bonds measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. hedged risks that meet the criteria for fair value hedge accounting are treated 
accordingly. the interest rate risk on the hedged assets and liabilities is measured at fair value through profit or loss. at end-2019, hedging derivatives 
measured at fair value accounted for about 0.3% of total assets and about 0.2% of total liabilities (31 december 2018: 0.2% and 0.05%, respectively).

(c) 
overview of classification and measurement basis for financial instruments and insurance contracts 
insurance activities – general 
the group issues life insurance policies, which are divided into insurance and investment contracts. insurance contracts are contracts that entail 
significant insurance risk or entitle policyholders to bonuses. investment contracts are contracts that entail no significant insurance risk and comprise 
unit-linked contracts under which the investment risk lies with the policyholder. 
insurance contracts 
insurance contracts comprise both an investment element and an insurance element, which are recognised as aggregate figures. 
 
ifrs 4, insurance contracts, includes an option to continue the accounting treatment of insurance contracts under local gaap. the group’s life insurance 
provisions are therefore recognised at their present value in accordance with the danish fsa’s executive order on financial reports for insurance 
companies etc. the life insurance provisions are presented under liabilities under insurance contracts. 
 
assets earmarked for insurance contracts are recognised under assets under insurance contracts if most of the return on the assets accrues to the 
policyholders. most of these assets are measured at fair value. 
 
investment contracts 
investment contracts are recognised as financial liabilities, and, consequently, contributions and benefits under such contracts are recognised directly 
in the balance sheet. deposits are measured at the value of the savings under deposits under pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts.  
 
savings under unit-linked investment contracts are measured at fair value under assets under pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts. 
the return on the assets and the crediting of the amounts to policyholders’ accounts are recognised under net trading income or loss. 
 
assets funded by shareholders’ equity  
the separate pool of assets equal to shareholders’ equity is recognised at fair value and consolidated with other similar assets. 
 
income from insurance business 
insurance activities are consolidated in the various income statement items. insurance premiums are recognised under net premiums. net insurance 
benefits in the income statement consists of benefits disbursed under insurance contracts and the annual change in insurance obligations not deriving 
from additional provisions for benefit guarantees and changes to the collective bonus potential. the return on earmarked assets is allocated to the 
relevant items in the income statement. the return to policyholders is recognised under net trading income or loss as are changes to additional 
provisions for benefit guarantees. note g8 provides more information. 
 
the sources of the group’s net income from insurance business comprise the return on assets funded by danica pension’s shareholders’ equity, income 
from unit-linked business and health and accident business, and income from conventional life insurance business, the so-called risk allowance. 
 
the risk allowance is determined in accordance with the danish fsa’s executive order on the contribution principle. the contribution principle regulates 
how earnings are allocated between policyholders and the life insurance company’s shareholders’ equity and defines the maximum payment to 
shareholders’ equity (the risk allowance). 
 
insurance contracts guarantee a certain long-term return on policyholders’ funds. if the technical basis exceeds the interest accrual to policyholders and 
the risk allowance, the difference is allocated to the bonus potential. the bonus potential serves as a risk buffer. if the technical basis is insufficient to 
cover the risk allowance, the shortfall can be covered by the bonus potential. if the bonus potential is insufficient to cover the shortfall, the difference can 
be covered by the individual bonus potentials or the profit margin; otherwise, the risk allowance that cannot be recognised will be lost. if the technical 
basis is insufficient to cover the interest accrual to policyholders, the shortfall is covered by the bonus potentials or the profit margin. any remaining 
shortfall is paid by the group in the form of an outlay. if the group has made such an outlay, the outlay may be recovered the following year.

(d) financial highlights 
the financial highlights and reporting for each segment shown in note g3 are used in the management’s report and represent the financial information 
regularly provided to management. the reclassification column in note g3 shows the reconciliation between the presentation in the financial highlights 
and the presentation in the consolidated financial statements prepared under ifrs and includes the following: 
 
operating leases and impairment charges other intangible assets 
in the ifrs income statement, gains or losses on the sale of operating lease assets, excluding properties, at the end of the lease agreement are presented 
on a gross basis (the group acts as a lessor). this means that the proceeds from the sale of the assets are recognised under other income, whereas the 
carrying amount of the lease assets is recognised under operating expenses.  
 
in the financial highlights, the gains or losses on the sale of the lease asset are presented on a net basis under other income to better reflect the 
development in the cost base.  
 
the group’s transformation project ‘better ways of working’ entails an ongoing digital journey that lead to the recognition of impairment charges on 
existing software in 2020. to better reflect the development in the underlying cost base, the impairment charges are presented separately in the financial 
highlights, whereas they are recognised under operating expenses in the ifrs income statement. 
 
fi&c and capital markets (both part of corporates & institutions) and group treasury (part of other activities)  
in the ifrs income statement, income from fi&c, capital markets and group treasury is presented as net interest income, net fee income, net trading 
income or loss and other income, depending on the type of income. the distribution of income between the various income line items can vary considerably 
from one year to the next, depending on the underlying transactions and market conditions. to better reflect income in those areas, the following 
reclassifications are made in the financial highlights:  
• 
all income contributed by fi&c, excluding fi&c’s share of margins on customer derivatives, is presented as net trading income 
• 
trading-related income at capital markets is presented as net trading income. however, income contributed by equity finance (also part of 
corporates & institutions, capital markets) is presented as net fee income 
• 
all income in group treasury, except income at internal bank, income on bonds held to collect and bonds held to collect and sell, are presented as 
net trading income 
 
danica pension  
in the ifrs income statement, income and expenses in danica pension (part of wealth management) is consolidated on a line-by-line basis. in the financial 
highlights, the following reclassifications are made to better reflect income from the services provided to customers: 
• 
the risk allowance and income from the unit-link business are presented as net fee income 
• 
the return on assets related to the health and accident business is presented as net trading income 
• 
the risk and guarantee result, the net income from the health and accident business and the income from recharge to customers of certain expenses 
are presented as other income 
• 
all costs, except external investment costs, are presented under operating expenses 
 
non-core  
in the ifrs income statement and balance sheet, income and expense items and asset and liability items from the non-core segment are included in the 
various income statement and balance sheet line items, as the segment does not fulfil the requirements in ifrs 5, non-current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations.  
 
the non-core segment includes certain customer segments that are no longer considered part of the group’s core business. to better reflect activities 
from the group’s core and non-core business, the profit or loss of the non-core segment is presented as one amount in a separate line item ‘profit before 
tax, non-core’ in the financial highlights. similarly, assets are presented together as total assets in non-core and liabilities together as total liabilities in 
non-core in the balance sheet in the financial highlights.

g2. changes and forthcoming changes to accounting policies and presentation 
 
(a) changes to significant accounting policies and presentation during the year 
on 1 january 2020, the group implemented amendments to ias 1 and ias 8 (definition of material), ifrs 3, business combinations (definition of a 
business) and amendments to references to the conceptual framework in ifrs standards.  
 
the amendments to ias 1 and ias 8 clarify the definition of material and aligns the definition of material used in the conceptual framework with that in 
the ifrs standards. the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2020. 
 
the amendments to ifrs 3 clarifies the definition of a business, with the objective of assisting a preparer to determine whether a transaction should be 
accounted for as a business combination or as the acquisition of assets. the clarifications are applicable for business combinations after 1 january 
2020. 
 
the implementation of the amendments had no impact on the group’s financial statements. 
 
(b) standards and interpretations not yet in force 
the international accounting standards board (iasb) has issued one new accounting standard (ifrs 17) and amendments to existing international 
accounting standards (ifrs 1, ifrs 3, ifrs 4, ifrs 7, ifrs 9, ifrs 16, ias 1, ias 16, ias 37, ias 39 and ias41) that have not yet come into force. the 
group has not early adopted any of the changes. the sections below explain the ifrs changes that are likely to affect the group’s future financial reporting. 
for the changes not described below, no significant impact is expected.  
 
ifrs 17, insurance contracts  
in may 2017, the iasb issued ifrs 17, insurance contracts. ifrs 17 replaces ifrs 4, insurance contracts, which was an interim standard that did not 
prescribe the measurement of insurance contracts but relied on existing accounting practices. ifrs 17 is a comprehensive standard with principles for, 
for example, the measurement of insurance contracts at a current (fulfilment) value in the balance sheet, the recognition of insurance contract revenue 
in the income statement and the presentation of information on the performance in relation to insurance contracts. in june 2020, the iasb issued some 
amendments to ifrs 17 which included a deferral of the effective date to 1 january 2023. 
 
ifrs 17 has not yet been adopted by the eu.  
 
the standard may have a significant impact on the financial statements due to the new principles for calculating insurance provisions and for the 
presentation in the income statement and balance sheet. the group has undertaken a pre-analysis to assess the impact on the group’s financial 
statements, including an assessment of the group’s insurance product in terms of classification and measurement and aggregation into portfolios. 
estimates using the 3 measurement approaches (building bloch approach, variable fee approach and premium allocation approach), including a 
calculation of the contractual service margin, have been made. this indicates, that after a transitional period, net profit before tax will not be significantly 
altered. 
 
interest rate benchmark reform – phase 2 (amendments to ifrs 9, ias 39, ifrs 7, ifrs 4 and ifrs 16) 
in august 2020, the iasb issued amendments to various standards to cover the effects on financial statements when old interest rate benchmarks are 
replaced by alternative benchmark rates as a result of the benchmark reform. the amendments are effective 1 january 2021, at which date the group 
will implement the amendments.  
 
the amendments introduce a practical expedient to account for a change to the basis for determination of the contractual cash flows at the date on which 
interest rate benchmarks are altered or replaced. under the practical expedient, a change to the determination of the contractual cash flows is applied 
prospectively by altering the effective interest rate, i.e. not leading to a modification gain or loss recognised in the income statement. to be applicable for 
the practical expedient, a change must meet two conditions: (a) the change is a direct consequence of the reform and (b) the new basis for determining 
the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis.  
 
the amendments further introduce reliefs from existing hedge accounting requirements, for example that hedge accounting would not discontinue solely 
due to the benchmark reform. the amendments further require that the hedging relationships and documentations are amended to reflect changes in 
the hedged item, the hedging instrument and the hedged risk (which do not represent a discontinuation of the exiting hedge).  
 
disclosure requirements are added. the disclosures relate to how the transition to alternative rates is managed, the progress on the transition and the 
risks arising from financial assets and financial liabilities due to the reform.  
 
the implementation is applied retrospectively without restatement of prior periods. as the transition to alternative benchmark rates for financial assets 
and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost has not yet taken place, the implementation of the amendments will have no impact on shareholders’ 
equity at 1 january 2021. following the reliefs from the existing hedge accounting requirements, the group expects that existing hedge relationships will 
continue to qualify for hedge accounting. the added disclosures on the transition to alternative rates will be included in annual report 2021.

supported by global product areas and local customer coverage, and acts as a bridge to the world for nordic customers as well as a gateway into the nordics 
for international customers. the unit bridges the financial needs of the institutional and corporate sectors, connecting issuers and investors. the unit is 
organised in four areas: a customer unit, named general banking, and three product areas; named capital markets, fixed income & currencies (fi&c) and 
transaction banking & investor services. in the first quarter of 2020, the business segmentation of fi&c and capital markets was changed, as debt capital 
markets (dcm) was moved from capital markets to fi&c and investment solutions from fi&c to capital markets.  
 
wealth management serves companies and institutional investors in the markets in which the group operates. the unit offers a broad range of products and 
services within wealth and asset management, investments, pension savings and insurance. the unit encompasses expertise from danica pension, danske 
invest and asset management.

non-core includes certain customer segments that are no longer considered part of the core business. the non-core unit is responsible for the controlled 
winding-up of this part of the loan portfolio. the portfolio consists primarily of loans to customers in the baltics and liquidity facilities for special purpose 
vehicles (spvs) and conduit structures. in addition to the exit from banking activities in estonia and russia at the end of 2019, the group had also exited 
from all banking activities in latvia by the end of the first quarter of 2020. 
 
other activities encompasses group treasury, group support functions and eliminations, including the elimination of returns on own shares and issues, 
as well as interest on additional tier 1 capital, which is reported as an interest expense in the business units. group treasury is responsible for the 
group’s liquidity management and funding. 
 
 
accounting policy  
segment reporting complies with the significant accounting policies. the ‘reclassification’ column shows adjustments made to the ifrs statements 
in the calculation of the financial highlights. 
 
internal income and expenses are allocated to the individual segments on an arm’s-length basis. expenses incurred centrally, including expenses 
incurred by support, administrative and back-office functions, are charged to the business units according to consumption and activity. funding costs 
for lending and deposit activities (ftp) are allocated on the basis of a maturity analysis of loans and deposits, interbank rates and funding spreads, and 
depend on market trends. 
 
segment assets and liabilities are assets and liabilities that are used for maintaining the operating activities of a segment or have come into existence 
as a result of such activities and which are either directly attributable or may be reasonably allocated to a segment. a calculated share of shareholders’ 
equity is allocated to each segment. other assets and liabilities are recognised under other activities. 
 
 
capital (shareholders’ equity) is allocated to the business units based on the group’s capital allocation framework, with goodwill allocated directly to 
the relevant business units. the framework is based on a regulatory approach and is calibrated to the group’s cet1 capital ratio target. therefore, the 
capital consumption of the individual business units is closely aligned with the group’s total capital consumption. however, for the northern ireland 
business unit, the capital allocated equals the legal entity’s capital.  
 
a calculated interest income equal to the risk-free return on its allocated capital is apportioned to each business unit and offset by a corresponding 
interest expense at other activities. this income is calculated on the basis of the short-term money market rate. the interest expense on equity 
accounted additional tier 1 capital is charged to the business units on the basis of the capital allocated to each unit and offset at other activities.

g3. business model and business segmentation continued 
 
presentation in the financial highlights and in the segment reporting 
segment reporting and the financial highlights are based on the information provided to management.  
 
an explanation of the items making up the reclassification column, which reconciles the financial highlights and segment reporting presentation to the 
ifrs financial statements, is provided further on in this note. 
 
changes in financial highlights and segment reporting  
from 1 january 2020, the presentation in the financial highlights and segment reporting has been changed to align the presentation with the segmentation 
within wealth management: 
 
• 
in june 2018, danica pension acquired danica pensionsforsikring (formerly seb pension danmark). danica pensionsforsikring merged into danica 
pension in 2019. the subsequent integration and conversion revealed some differences between the presentation of danica pensionsforsikring and 
danica pension in the financial highlights and the segment reporting for wealth management. as of the first quarter of 2020, income from the hedge of 
assets under insurance contracts in danica pensionsforsikring has been reclassified from net fee income to net trading income in the financial highlights 
and the segment reporting for wealth management to align with the presentation for danica pension. at the same time, the method for presentation of 
the value of hedges in danica pensionsforsikring has been aligned with the method in danica pension, which affects assets under management.  
• 
in 2019, the business segmentation of danica pension was changed. the changes included a bundling of the health and accident insurance business with 
the life insurance business. therefore, the risk result from health and accident insurance has been reclassified from other income to net fee income in 
the financial highlights and the segment reporting for wealth management as of the first quarter of 2020 to align with the presentation for life insurance, 
which is presented as net fee income.  
  
the group’s transformation project ‘better ways of working’ entails an ongoing digital journey that lead to the recognition of impairment charges on existing 
software in 2020. to better reflect the development in the underlying cost base, the impairment charges are presented separately from operating expenses 
in the financial highlights. similarly, the cost/income ratio in the financial highlights has been supplemented by the ratio calculated as costs excluding the 
impairment charges on goodwill and software. 
 
in the financial highlights, due from credit institutions and central banks has been restated to include also demand deposits with central banks.  
 
the impact on the financial highlights for 2019 is shown in the table below. the changes do not affect the presentation in the ifrs income statement or 
balance sheet.

the ‘reclassification’ column shows the reconciliation between the presentation in the financial highlights and the presentation in the ifrs statements.  
 
the reclassifications are explained in note g1(d). 
 
the group’s internal reporting on business segments does not include tax. tax is therefore not allocated to the business units, but solely presented within 
the total amount.

the ‘reclassification’ column shows the reconciliation between the presentation in the financial highlights and the presentation in the ifrs statements.  
 
the reclassifications are explained in note g1(d). 
 
the group’s internal reporting on business segments does not include tax. tax is therefore not allocated to the business units, but solely presented within 
the total amount.

corporate and commercial banking comprises interest and fee income from corporate and commercial banking products and services. home finance 
and savings comprises interest and fee income from financing and savings products. trading comprises income from fixed-income and foreign exchange

and deposits. asset management comprises income from the management of assets at danske capital and unit-linked investment contracts at danica 
pension. leasing encompasses income from both finance and operating leases sold by the group’s leasing operations in denmark, sweden, norway and 
finland. life conventional comprises income in danica pension from conventional life insurance contracts (danica traditionel). 
 
danske bank group does not have any single customer that generates 10% or more of the group’s total income. 
 
(d) geographical segmentation 
the geographical segmentation of income from external customers is shown in compliance with ifrss and does not reflect the group’s management 
structure. the geographical segmentation below reflects the customer’s country of residence, except trading income, which is broken down by the country 
in which the activities are carried out. management believes that the business segmentation provides a more informative description of the group’s 
activities.

under crd iv, a financial institution must disclose, by country in which it operates through a subsidiary or a branch, information about income, number 
of employees, profit before tax, tax and public subsidies received. this information is not comparable to the geographical segmentation presented in note 
g3(c), in which segmentation is based on the customer’s country of residence. the group has not received any public subsidies that relate to the group’s 
activities as a financial institution.

g4. activities by country 
 
under crd iv, a financial institution must disclose, by country in which it operates through a subsidiary or a branch, information about income, number 
of employees, profit before tax, tax and public subsidies received. this information is not comparable to the geographical segmentation presented in note 
g3(c), in which segmentation is based on the customer’s country of residence. the group has not received any public subsidies that relate to the group’s 
activities as a financial institution.

g5. net interest and net trading income or loss 
 
this note shows interest income, interest expense and net trading income or loss broken down by balance sheet item and by portfolios of financial instruments 
measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. 
 
accounting policy  
interest income and expenses 
interest income and expenses arising from interest-bearing financial instruments measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income are recognised according to the effective interest method on the basis of the cost of the individual financial instrument. interest 
includes amortised amounts of fees that are an integral part of the effective yield on a financial instrument, such as origination fees, and amortised 
differences between the cost and the redemption price, if any. interest on financial instruments included in stage 3 (for the calculation of expected credit 
losses) is recognised on the basis of the carrying amount (i.e. net of impairment charges). the interest rate risk on some financial portfolios recognised 
at amortised cost is hedged by derivatives using fair value hedge accounting. note g12 provides more information on hedge accounting. interest income 
calculated using the effective interest method and presented as a separate line item in the income statement excludes the impact from hedge 
accounting. 
 
further, interest income and expenses includes interest on financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss. among others, this 
includes interest income on loans measured at fair value for which interest on loans included in stage 3 is recognised on the basis of the gross carrying 
amount. however, interest on assets and deposits under pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts is recognised under net trading income 
or loss. in the income statement, interest income on financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss is presented under the line item other 
interest income, while the line item interest expenses includes all interest expenses. 
 
net trading income or loss 
net trading income or loss includes realised and unrealised capital gains and losses on financial assets and financial liabilities recognised at fair value 
through profit or loss as well as exchange rate adjustments and dividends. however, the fair value adjustments of the credit risk on loans granted by 
realkredit danmark are presented under loan impairment charges. further, the fair value adjustment of own credit risk on financial liabilities in the 
group’s trading units (fi&c and capital markets part of c&i) designated at fair value through profit or loss is presented in other comprehensive income. 
net trading income or loss includes the fair value adjustments of own credit risk on bonds issued by realkredit danmark, as an accounting mismatch 
between the fair value adjustment of the loans and the bonds in realkredit danmark would otherwise exist (see further information in note g16).  
 
realised gains and losses on financial assets at amortised cost, e.g. loans, are recognised under net trading income or loss when the financial asset is 
derecognised, unless the derecognition relates to a credit risk event/forbearance measure, in which case the gain or loss is presented under loan 
impairment charges (see note g15). otherwise, the derecognition gain or loss on the financial asset is calculated as the difference between the carrying 
amount (gross of expected credit losses) and the repayment amount. for financial assets (bonds) at fair value through other comprehensive income, 
gains or losses further include amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income. for financial liabilities at amortised cost, the gain or 
loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the redemption price including cost related to the redemption, if any.  
 
for financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value hedge accounting, the fair value adjustments of the hedged financial instrument and the hedging 
instruments are recognised in net trading income or loss. therefore, any hedge ineffectiveness is presented in net trading income or loss.  
 
net trading income or loss also includes the change in insurance obligations during the year due to additional provisions for benefit guarantees and the 
tax on pension returns. 
 
returns (interest income and fair value changes) on assets under pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts and the crediting of these 
returns to customer accounts are recognised under net trading income or loss.

g6. fee income and expenses 
 
fee income and expenses are presented on a net fee income basis as presented in the management’s report, representing the presentation provided to 
key management for decision making purposes. net fee income is broken down by fee type on the basis of the underlying activity, and by business segment. 
 
accounting policy 
fee income 
fee income is recognised to reflect the transfer of services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received 
in exchange for such services. the group identifies the performance obligation, i.e. the services agreed with the customer, and the consideration, and 
recognises income in line with the transfer of services, the performance obligation, agreed with the customer.  
 
for each performance obligation identified, the group determines at contract inception whether it satisfies the performance obligation over time or at 
a point in time, and whether the consideration is fixed or variable, including whether consideration is constrained by, for instance, external factors 
outside the group’s influence. the consideration is subsequently allocated to the identified performance obligation.  
 
when income is highly susceptible to external factors, such as the development in the financial markets, the income is recognised once the 
consideration to be received is known and it is probable that a significant reversal of the consideration will not occur. 
 
for income derived from the provision of agency services the consideration is presented on a net basis. 
 
other types of fee income relates to pension and insurance activities and are recognised in accordance with ifrs 4, insurance contracts. 
 
fee expense 
fee expense for services provided over a period of time, such as guarantee commissions and investment management fees, are accrued over the period. 
transaction fees, such as brokerage and custody fees, are recognised on settlement of the individual transaction. fees that form an integral part of the 
effective rates of interest on financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, such as origination fees, are carried under interest expense. similar fees 
related to financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised when the financial liability is established and are carried under fee 
expense. 
 
 
(a) presentation by activity  
fee income is managed internally net of fee expenses, and on the basis of the underlying activity, i.e. 
• 
investment 
• 
pension and insurance 
• 
money transfers, account fees, cash management 
• 
lending and guarantees 
• 
capital markets 
 
see note g3 for net fee income per business segment. a description of each activity by business segment is provided below: 
 
banking units 
fee income in the banking units relates to banking dk, banking nordic, general banking in c&i, northern ireland, and it primarily relates to the provision 
of general banking services to customers, i.e.: 
 
fee income from investment activities, for example for executing customer security purchase orders, is recognised at the time of the transaction. when 
the service is provided over time, for example fee income for managed accounts, fee income is recognised over time. 
 
fee income from money transfers, account fees and cash management activities, is generally recognised when the service is provided. for transactions 
such as money transfers and card transaction, fee income is recognised at the time of the transaction. fee income charged for services provided over 
time, for example subscription fees, account packages and cash deposit services, is recognised over time as the service is provided to the customer.  
 
fee income from lending and guarantee activities, such as services provided in relation to mortgage loans recognised at fair value, and the provision of 
trade finance guarantees, is recognised when the service has been provided to the customer at a point in time. for fee income for establishing loans 
recognised at amortised cost, although the performance obligation is satisfied when the loan is granted, the fee income is recognised over time (the 
expected maturity of the loan), in accordance with ifrs 9 and classified as interest income. the same applies to the group’s participation in syndicated 
loan transactions. 
 
c&i  
net fee income in c&i relates to income derived from general banking (see above description of banking units) and from fi&c and capital markets. 
 
fee income derived from fi&c is reclassified to net trading income or loss in the segment reporting, however, fi&c’s share of margins on customer 
derivatives is presented as part of fee income (note g3 provides further information). except for margins on customer derivatives, fee income consists 
mainly of fees received for services provided at a point in time.

fee income in capital markets primarily consists of:  
 
fee income from investment activities, for example executing share trades on behalf of customers and securities lending, is recognised when the service 
is provided at a point in time. 
 
fee income from lending and guarantee activities is primarily derived from coordinating and arranging syndicated loan transactions, as well as issuing 
bonds on behalf of customers. such income is recognised at a point in time, once the agreed performance obligation has been fulfilled.  
 
fee income from capital markets activities is primarily derived from arranging transactions on behalf of customers. such income is recognised when the 
individual performance obligation has been fulfilled. 
 
wealth management 
fee income in wealth management relates to asset management and danica pension. fee income for asset management services is recognised over 
time when the service is provided to the customer provided that it is probable that a significant reversal of the consideration will not occur. such income 
relates to investment, pension and insurance activities. 
 
performance fee income is variable, and the consideration is based on the accumulated return on the underlying asset, determined at a specific date, 
such as the end of the year. the accumulated return is highly susceptible to external factors, such as the development in the financial markets. fee income 
is recognised once the fee to be received is known. the fee income relates to investment activities.

g9. operating expenses 
 
operating expenses includes staff costs, administrative expenses and depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges. note g19 provides more 
information on intangible assets. 
 
the group uses quantitative and qualitative materiality assessments in relation to presenting additional line items in the income statement. in 2019, it 
is considered relevant for the understanding of the financial performance to present the goodwill impairment charges as a separate line item in the 
income statement. 
 
accounting policy 
staff costs  
this item includes salaries, performance-based pay, expenses for share-based payments, holiday allowances, anniversary bonuses, pension costs and 
other remuneration. salaries and other remuneration that the group expects to pay are expensed when the employees render the services. 
performance-based remuneration is expensed as it is earned. 
 
share-based payment 
part of the performance-based remuneration for the year is paid in the form of conditional shares. rights to conditional shares vest up to four years 
after the grant date, provided that the employee, with the exception of retirement, has not resigned from the group. in addition to this requirement, the 
vesting of rights is conditional on certain targets being met. the fair value of share-based payments at the grant date is expensed over the vesting period 
with the intrinsic value expensed in the year in which the share-based payments are earned, and the time value (if any) accrued over the remaining 
service period. expenses are set off against shareholders’ equity. fair value adjustments after the grant date are not recognised in the income 
statement. 
  
pension obligations 
the group’s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the income statement as they are earned by the employees. for 
defined benefit pension plans, the group expenses the standard cost. actuarial gains or losses as a result of the difference between expected trends in 
pension assets and benefits and actual trends are recognised under other comprehensive income. 
 
amortisation, depreciation and impairment charges 
in addition to amortisation, depreciation and impairment charges for intangible, tangible and right-of-use assets, the group expenses the carrying 
amount of lease assets sold at the expiry of a lease agreement.

(b) pension plans 
most of the group’s pension plans are defined contribution plans under which the group pays contributions to insurance companies, including danica pension. 
such payments are expensed regularly. the group has, to a minor extent, entered into defined benefit pension plans. under defined benefit pension plans, the 
group is under an obligation to pay defined future benefits from the time of retirement. defined benefit pension plans are typically funded by ordinary 
contributions made by employers and employees to separate pension funds investing the contributions on behalf of the members to fund future pension 
obligations. defined benefit pension plans in northern ireland and ireland account for most of the group’s obligations under such plans, but the group also 
has a small number of defined benefit pension plans in denmark and sweden. the plans in these countries do not accept new members and, for most of the

liability of dkk 59 million was derecognised and a settlement gain of dkk 25 million was recognised in the fourth quarter of 2020. a similar project was 
undertaken in 2019 leading to the derecognition of a pension liability of dkk 190 million and a settlement gain of dkk 62 million. the group recognises the 
service cost and interest on the net defined benefit pension asset/liability in the income statement, whereas actuarial gains or losses are recognised under 
other comprehensive income. 
 
the calculation of the net obligation is based on valuations made by external actuaries. these valuations rely on assumptions about a number of variables, 
including discount and mortality rates and salary increases. the measurement of the net obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate. 
the discount rate is determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds with terms matching the terms of the pension obligations. if the discount 
rate was lowered half a percentage point, the gross pension obligation would increase dkk 1.7 billion (2019: dkk 1.6 billion). the amount would be 
recognised under other comprehensive income.

(b) pension plans 
most of the group’s pension plans are defined contribution plans under which the group pays contributions to insurance companies, including danica pension. 
such payments are expensed regularly. the group has, to a minor extent, entered into defined benefit pension plans. under defined benefit pension plans, the 
group is under an obligation to pay defined future benefits from the time of retirement. defined benefit pension plans are typically funded by ordinary 
contributions made by employers and employees to separate pension funds investing the contributions on behalf of the members to fund future pension 
obligations. defined benefit pension plans in northern ireland and ireland account for most of the group’s obligations under such plans, but the group also 
has a small number of defined benefit pension plans in denmark and sweden. the plans in these countries do not accept new members and, for most of the 
plans, contributions payable by existing members have been discontinued. 
 
at 31 december 2020, the net present value of pension obligations was dkk 17,558 million (2019: dkk 17,331 million), and the fair value of plan assets 
was dkk 19,463 million (2019: dkk 18,891 million). the present value of obligations under defined benefit pension plans less the fair value of pension assets 
is recognised for each plan under other assets and other liabilities. pension plan net assets amounted to dkk 2,547 million (2019: dkk 2,252 million) and 
pension plan net liabilities amounted to dkk 642 million (2019: dkk 692 million).

(c) explanation of derivatives 
the group’s activities in the financial markets include trading in derivatives. derivatives are financial instruments whose value depends on the value of 
an underlying instrument or index etc. derivatives can be used to manage market risk exposure, for example. the group trades a considerable volume of 
the most commonly used interest rate, currency and equity derivatives, including 
 
• 
swaps 
• 
forwards and futures 
• 
options 
 
the group trades a limited number of swaps whose value depends on developments in specific credit or commodity risks, or inflation indices. 
 
the group trades derivatives as part of servicing customers’ needs as individual transactions or as integral parts of other services, such as the issuance 
of bonds with yields that depend on developments in equity or currency indices. the group also uses derivatives to manage the group’s own exposure to 
foreign exchange, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. the risk management notes provide additional information about the group’s risk 
management policy. corporates & institutions is responsible for the day-to-day management and hedging of the group’s market risks. 
 
derivatives are recognised and measured at fair value. some of the group’s loans, deposits, issued bonds, etc. in the group’s banking units and group 
treasury carry fixed rates. generally, such fixed-rate items are recognised at amortised cost. further, the group classifies certain bonds as ‘hold to 
collect and sell’ financial assets. unrealised value adjustments of such bonds are recognised under other comprehensive income. the group uses fair 
value hedge accounting if the interest rate risk on fixed-rate financial assets and liabilities or bonds measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income is hedged by derivatives.

(d) explanation of hedge accounting 
an overview over the risks the group is exposed to and how they are defined is provided on the first page of the notes risk management. for some of 
those risks hedge accounting is applied. the group uses fair value hedge accounting for hedges of interest rate risk. further, the group hedges part of 
the foreign currency risk on net investment in foreign entities. 
 
hedge of interest rate risk 
the group manages the fixed interest rate risk on financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost as a combination of economic hedges 
(matching of interest rate risk from assets and liabilities at amortised cost across the group’s banking units) and hedges using interest rate swaps. 
group treasury is responsible for the risk management of the interest rate risk (the so-called interest rate risk in the banking book). in the risk 
management process, economic hedges are established and/or identified. this includes the acquisition of ‘hold to collect’ fixed interest rate bonds in 
group treasury and the identification of fixed-rate loans extended by the group’s banking units to hedge the fixed interest rate risk on liabilities (including 
core demand deposits). interest rate risk on fixed-rate liabilities (such as long dated funding via bond issuance) is generally hedged by interest rate swaps 
and the interest rate risk on certain fixed-rate assets can be hedged using derivatives as well. for further information see risk management section 
market risk in relation to non-trading portfolios at group treasury and interest rate risk in the banking book (irrbb). 
 
when the group uses swaps to hedge the fixed interest rate risk on financial instruments, the group applies fair value hedge accounting using the option 
in ifrs 9 to continue to apply the fair value hedge accounting provisions in ias 39. fair value hedge accounting can be applied if changes in the fair value 
of the hedging swaps are expected to be effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed interest rate risk. this requires (1) a formal 
designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, including a risk management objective and strategy for the hedge, (2) that the hedge is 
expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged interest rate risk, (3) the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably 
measured and (4) the hedge on an ongoing basis has proven to be effective in actually offsetting of changes in fair value. with effective hedging, the hedged 
interest rate risk on hedged assets and liabilities is measured at fair value and recognised as a value adjustment of the hedged items. value adjustments 
on the hedged item and the hedging swaps are presented in the income statement under net trading income or loss. any ineffective portion of a hedge 
that lies within the range for effective hedging is therefore also included under net trading income or loss. 
 
the interest rate is considered fixed if the interest rate resets to a reference rate with a term longer than three months. once a financial instrument has 
been designated as a hedged item it will remain as hedged item for the life of the instrument. for hedged assets and liabilities to which a fixed rate of 
interest applies for a specified period of time starting at the commencement date of the agreement, future interest payments are split into basis interest 
and a customer margin and into periods of time. by entering into swaps or forwards with matching payment profiles in the same currencies and for the 
same periods, the group hedges the risk at portfolio level from the commencement date of the hedged items. the fair values of the hedged interest rate 
risk and the hedging derivatives are measured at frequent intervals to ensure that changes in the fair value of the hedged interest rate risk lie within a 
band of 80-125% of the changes in the fair value of the hedging derivatives. portfolios of hedging derivatives are adjusted if necessary. at least on a 
weekly basis, the need for adjustments is assessed. 
 
the primary reasons for changes in the fair value of fixed interest rate financial assets are changes in the interest rate risk and the credit risk.  
 
hedge ineffectiveness relates to the fact that fair value changes on the hedged items are measured based on the interest rate curve relevant for each 
hedged item while the fair value of the fixed legs of the hedging derivatives are measured based on a swap curve. further, the adjustment of the portfolios 
of hedging derivatives to changes in hedged positions is not done instantly, and some hedge ineffectiveness can therefore exist. 
 
the ongoing interest rate benchmark reform will replace existing benchmark inter-bank offered rates (ibors) with alternative risk-free rates. at the 
beginning of 2019, the group formally established an ibor transition programme, the main objectives being to identify how the ibor transition will affect 
the group financially and operationally and to recommend the best implementation of the transition, mitigate risks, implement changes in contractual 
relationships, etc. the calculation methodology behind euribor has been amended and is now recognised as being fully compliant with the eu benchmark 
regulation. further, danske bank expects that euribor will continue in a foreseeable future and sees no need for contractual changes. danske bank 
also expects cibor, nibor and stibor to continue in the foreseeable future. libor is expected to discontinue after 2021. however, it is possible that 
libor rates could continue to be published after 2021. in the second half of 2020, eur and usd denominated swaps cleared on a ccp have been 
converted to, respectively, estr and sofr discounting. changes to the contractual terms for a transition of libor to new risk free rates have not started. 
it is a top priority for the group to conduct the transition in a timely and orderly manner that is transparent and fair to our customers.  
 
in 2019, iasb issued amendments ias 39 (interest rate benchmark reform phase i) providing reliefs from some of the effectiveness requirements. for 
the purpose of the expected effectiveness, it is assumed that the benchmark reform will not alter the cash flows. further, a hedge will not disqualify if the 
actual result of the hedge falls outside the band of 80-125%, if the other requirements for applying hedge accounting is fulfilled. the relief covers the 
period during which uncertainty on the timing and the amount of the amended or replaced reference rates exists. based on this, the current uncertainty 
in relation to reference rates that have not yet been amended or replaced does not have an impact on the group’s ability to use fair value hedge accounting 
on existing hedging relationships. 
 
the tables below shows the hedging derivatives and the hedged fixed interest rate financial instruments, including a breakdown of the hedging derivatives 
at the end of 2020 and 2019 by the major reference rates as considered above. the reliefs provided in the amendments to ias 39 by iasb are used on 
hedging relationships covering fair value changes on interest rate risk on libor and the reference rates on the scandinavian markets while the 
uncertainty of future cash flows related to the reform of euribor, subsequent to the amendment of the calculation method, is less significant.

in relation to reference rates that have not yet been amended or replaced does not have an impact on the group’s ability to use fair value hedge accounting 
on existing hedging relationships. 
 
the tables below shows the hedging derivatives and the hedged fixed interest rate financial instruments, including a breakdown of the hedging derivatives 
at the end of 2020 and 2019 by the major reference rates as considered above. the reliefs provided in the amendments to ias 39 by iasb are used on 
hedging relationships covering fair value changes on interest rate risk on libor and the reference rates on the scandinavian markets while the 
uncertainty of future cash flows related to the reform of euribor, subsequent to the amendment of the calculation method, is less significant.

hedge of foreign exchange risk on net investments in foreign entities 
the group hedges its foreign exchange risk on net investments in foreign currency units. foreign exchange risk is defined as risk of losses from translating 
the net investments in foreign entities that are denominated in a foreign currency other than dkk. the net investment in foreign currency units includes 
the net assets and goodwill of the units. the group has granted loans in the currency of the foreign unit to its branches in sweden, norway and finland 
for a total of dkk 34,612 million (2019: 33,206 million). the loans represent the capital allocated to these units. the settlement of the loans is neither 
planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and they are a part of the net investment in those units. further, danske bank a/s has granted the 
subsidiary northern bank an additional tier 1 capital instrument that together with shareholders’ equity in northern bank is considered part of the net 
investment in northern bank. the exchange differences from translating net profit in the foreign units at the date of underlying transactions and assets 
and liabilities at the closing rate and from translating the opening net assets at a closing rate that differs from the previous closing rate are recognised 
in other comprehensive income (translation differences). 
 
the group hedges the foreign exchange risk of net investments in branches and subsidiaries outside denmark by designating funding arrangements in 
the matching currencies as a hedge of the foreign exchange risk on the net investments. the foreign exchange differences on the funding arrangements 
are recognised in other comprehensive income to offset the exchange differences on the net investments. the funding arrangements consist primarily 
of issued bonds. realised net profit is hedged in the beginning of the next month. the group does not hedge the expected financial results of units outside 
denmark or other future transactions. in terms of assessing hedge effectiveness, this is applied by comparing the nominal value of the funding 
arrangement to the nominal value of the net investments. hedge ineffectiveness can arise to the extent the funding arrangements exceed the net 
investments. however, when the net investments are decreased, e.g. when the net investments are reduced by paying out dividend, the same amount of 
funding arrangements are de-designated as hedges and the funding arrangements designated as hedges will therefore, in general, not exceed the net 
investments. 
 
from may 2019, part of the funding of the loans granted to the branches in sweden, norway and finland was changed to dkk in order to create a so-
called structural fx hedge position in accordance with banking regulation, i.e. to reduce the impact on capital ratios resulting from changes in the risk 
exposure amount due to changes in currency rates. this strategy of partly hedging the sensitivity to capital ratios from volatility in foreign currency rates, 
increases the volatility in other comprehensive income and the foreign currency translation reserve in equity under ifrs since it decrease the hedge of 
the currency risk on the net investments in those units. at the end of 2020, the structural fx hedge totalled dkk 31,625 million (2019: dkk 29,988 
million) and a loss of dkk 411 million (2019: gain of dkk 286 million) has been recognised in other comprehensive income. for further information, see 
risk management section on market risk - structural fx risk. 
 
the cumulative exchange differences on the hedging instrument and the translation differences related to the net investment is reclassified from other 
comprehensive income to the income statement on the disposal of the foreign entities.

g13. investment securities 
 
investment securities consists of bonds and shares held by non-trading units in the group. it consists primarily of the liquidity portfolio managed by group 
treasury. the liquidity portfolio includes different portfolios with different business models. some portfolios are managed on a fair value basis and 
mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss under ifrs 9, whereas other portfolios are either ‘hold to collect and sell’ and measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive income or ‘hold to collect’. 
 
accounting policy  
financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (fvpl)  
financial assets measured at fair value include securities that are managed on a fair value basis with no short-term profit taking. realised and unrealised 
capital gains and losses and dividends are carried in the income statement under net trading income or loss. further, all shares (including unlisted 
shares) and bonds held in group treasury that do not have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding (i.e. that does not pass the sppi test in ifrs 9) are mandatorily measured at fvpl and, consequently, included in this category. 
 
financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (fvoci) 
this category comprises bonds only, and primarily bonds listed in a liquid market, as the group does not use the option to designate equity instruments 
at fvoci. the bonds are held within a business model for the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows and selling (hold to collect and sell). the bonds 
have cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (i.e. that passes the sppi test in ifrs 9). fvoci 
results in the assets being recognised at fair value in the balance sheet and at amortised cost in the income statement, including the recognition of 
expected credit losses as described in note g15. gains and losses, except for expected credit losses and foreign exchanges gains and losses, are 
therefore recognised in other comprehensive income until the bond is derecognised. when a fixed interest rate risk is hedged in a hedge that qualifies 
for fair value hedge accounting, the fair value changes of the hedged interest risk are presented in the income statement under net trading income or 
loss. when bonds are sold unrealised value adjustments recognised under other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement and 
presented under net trading income or loss. the group recognises interest income according to the effective interest method, including amortisation 
of the difference between cost and the redemption value over the term to maturity of the bonds.  
 
financial assets measured at amortised cost (amc) 
this category consists of bonds held within a business model for the purpose of collecting the contractual cash flows (hold to collect) and with cash 
flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (i.e. that pass the sppi test in ifrs 9). the bonds are 
measured at amortised cost. interest income is recognised according to the effective interest method, including amortisation of the difference between 
cost and the redemption value over the term to maturity of the bonds. the bonds are subject to the expected credit model in ifrs 9 as described in note 
g15. the interest rate risk on fixed-rate bonds are not hedged.

(b) further explanation  
investment securities consists of the liquidity portfolio held by group treasury. the liquidity portfolio is part of the balance sheet management to optimise 
the balance sheet composition, to hedge the interest rate risk in the banking book and to manage the group’s liquidity need. the management of the 
interest rate risk in the banking book is carried out through a combination of hedges with derivatives and partly through matching the duration on the 
fixed interest rate deposits (the interest risk on core deposits) with bond holdings with a matching duration. the latter is carried out through the 
acquisition of portfolios of bonds.  
 
financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (fvpl) 
this portfolio includes the part of the liquidity bond portfolio that is actively traded although less frequently than what is required to be classified as a 
held-for-trading portfolio. these bonds are held in a business model being neither ‘hold to collect’ nor ‘hold to collect and sell’ and are therefore mandatorily 
recognised at fair value through profit or loss under ifrs 9. 
 
the portfolio comprises primarily danish mortgage bonds. further, the portfolio includes listed and unlisted shares. 
 
financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (fvoci)  
this portfolio includes the part of the liquidity bond portfolio where both the collection of the contractual cash flows and sales are an integral part of 
achieving the objectives with the acquired bond portfolio. further, the bonds included in the portfolio have contractual cash flows that pass the sppi test. 
 
the performance of the portfolio is measured on a combination of the collection of the contractual cash flows and sales proceeds. sales typically occur 
when market opportunities arise, or when there is a need to adjust the portfolio to hedge part of the interest rate risk on the group’s core deposits. there 
is no objective of short-term profit taking and the performance reporting related to this portfolio reflects a combination of the collection of the contractual 
cash flows and realising fair value changes. the business model is therefore ‘hold to collect and sell’. 
 
the portfolio comprises primarily highly-rated covered, sovereign, supranational and agency bonds. 
 
financial assets measured at amortised cost (amc) 
this portfolio includes the part of the liquidity bond portfolio that is held in a business model being ‘hold to collect’, i.e. with the purpose of generating a 
return until maturity. further, the bonds included in the portfolio have contractual cash flows that pass the sppi test. 
 
the performance is measured based on the collection of the contractual cash flows. the fair value of the portfolio is monitored for liquidity purposes as 
the bonds can be used in repo transactions. sales from the portfolio are infrequent. when sales are made, they reflect: 
• 
sales close to maturity (the proceeds from the sale approximate the collection of contractual cash flows) 
• 
sales are made to manage risk concentration (e.g. the sale of bonds is made due to a concentration of currency risk) 
• 
sales made due to increase in credit risk above a certain level (i.e. outside the investment policy) 
 
the bonds are primarily danish mortgage bonds, government bonds and government-guaranteed bonds. some 99% of the portfolio is rated aa or higher 
(2019: 94%), while the remaining portfolio has investment grade ratings. 
 
sppi test applied for bonds at fvoci or amc 
the sppi test is applied for each bond to assess whether the contractual cash flows represent repayment of principal amount and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding. bonds that are included in the portfolios at fvoci or amc are generally plain vanilla bonds that: 
• 
have a fixed maturity, i.e. no perpetual bonds 
• 
do not have terms that introduce exposure to risk or volatility, e.g. by a yield that refers to changes in equity or commodity prices  
• 
are not subordinated or convertible bonds 
• 
can be prepaid (e.g. at par plus accrued interest), with the fair value of the prepayment option being insignificant at initial recognition. in general, this 
will be the case if the premium/discount to the contractual par amount is insignificant at initial recognition 
 
bonds that are not compliant with the sppi test are included in the portfolio of bonds at fvpl.

g14. due from credit institutions and central banks  
 
the item due from credit institutions and central banks includes both balances that are measured at amortised cost and balances that are measured at 
fair value through profit or loss, depending on the business model for the management of the amounts due from credit institutions.  
 
accounting policy 
for balances due from credit institutions in the group’s banking units (banking dk, banking nordic, general banking in c&i, northern ireland and non-
core), the business model is hold to collect. as the contractual cash flows represent basic lending feature, these balances are measured at amortised 
cost. for further information on the accounting policy etc., see note g15.  
 
for balances due from credit institutions and central banks in the group’s trading units (fi&c and capital markets in c&i) the business model is neither 
‘hold to collect’ nor ‘hold to collect and sell’ and these balances are mandatorily recognised at fair value through profit or loss. for further information 
on the accounting policy, see note g16.  
 
 
cash in hand and demand deposits with central banks

the item due from credit institutions and central banks includes both balances that are measured at amortised cost and balances that are measured at
fair value through profit or loss, depending on the business model for the management of the amounts due from credit institutions.
accounting policy
for balances due from credit institutions in the group’s banking units (banking dk, banking nordic, general banking in c&i, northern ireland and non-
core), the business model is hold to collect. as the contractual cash flows represent basic lending feature, these balances are measured at amortised
cost. for further information on the accounting policy etc., see note g15.
for balances due from credit institutions and central banks in the group’s trading units (fi&c and capital markets in c&i) the business model is neither
‘hold to collect’ nor ‘hold to collect and sell’ and these balances are mandatorily recognised at fair value through profit or loss. for further information
on the accounting policy, see note g16.
cash in hand and demand deposits with central banks
includes cash in hand of dkk 6,132 million and demand deposits of dkk 314,572 million (measured at amortised cost).

g15. loans at amortised cost  
 
in general, the loans in the group’s banking units (banking dk, banking nordic, general banking in c&i, northern ireland and non-core) are held with the 
objective of collecting the contractual cash flows. therefore, most of the group’s loans in the banking units are classified as ‘hold to collect’ under ifrs 
9. further, the loans have basic lending features with the contractual cash flows solely representing repayment of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding (the sppi test). therefore, the loans in the group’s banking units are recognised at amortised cost. the only exception is loans 
granted by realkredit danmark (see note g16) that are recognised at fair value, as the contractual cash flows do not represent basic lending features 
only, i.e. they do not pass the sppi test in ifrs 9.  
 
accounting policy 
at initial recognition, loans are measured at fair value plus transaction costs less origination fees and other charges that are an integral part of the 
effective interest rate on loans. this usually corresponds to the amount disbursed to the customer. subsequently, they are measured at amortised 
cost, using the effective interest method, less impairment charges for expected credit losses. the difference between the value at initial recognition 
and the redemption value is amortised over the term to maturity as part of the effective interest. if fixed-rate loans are hedged effectively by derivatives, 
the fair value of the hedged interest rate risk is added to the carrying amount of the hedged assets. 
 
impairment for expected credit losses  
the impairment charge for expected credit losses depends on whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition and follows a 
three stage model: 
 
• 
stage 1: if the credit risk has not increased significantly, the impairment charge equals the expected credit losses resulting from default events 
that are possible within the next 12 months. 
• 
stage 2: if the credit risk has increased significantly, the loan is transferred to stage 2 and an impairment charge equal to the lifetime expected 
credit losses is recognised. 
• 
stage 3: if the loan is in default or otherwise credit impaired, it is transferred to stage 3, for which the impairment charge continues to equal the 
lifetime expected credit losses but with interest income being recognised on the net carrying amount. 
 
the expected credit loss is calculated for all individual facilities as a function of the probability of default (pd), the exposure at default (ead) and the loss 
given default (lgd) and incorporates forwards looking elements. for facilities in stages 2 and 3, the lifetime expected credit losses cover the expected 
remaining lifetime of a facility.  
 
expected credit loss impairment charges are booked in an allowance account and allocated to individual exposures.

(b) further explanation  
 
classification and measurement – business model assessment 
the business model assessment in danske bank group is applied separately for each business unit represented by the group’s reportable segments. 
the assessment is based on observable factors for the different portfolios, such as (1) how the performance of the business model and the financial 
assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the executive board and the board of directors, (2) the risks that affect the 
performance of the business model and the way such risks are managed and (3) past and expected frequency, value and timing of sales for the portfolio.  
 
in the group’s banking units (banking dk, banking nordic, general banking in c&i, northern ireland and non-core), the management and reporting of 
performance are based on collecting the contractual cash flows, and loans are only very infrequently sold. therefore, the business model has been 
assessed as being ‘hold to collect’.

g15. loans at amortised cost continued 
 
once a year, the group assesses if past sales are consistent with the business model for loans in the group’s banking unit being ‘hold to collect’. in general, 
if sales are below 5% of the size of a portfolio the sales are considered to be insignificant. larger sales are considered individually in relation to 
consistency with the business model. the following sales are consistent with the business model being ‘hold to collect’: 
• 
loans are sold after having previously been transferred to one of the group’s debt collection units 
• 
loans are sold to manage credit concentration risk (specific countries or industries) 
• 
loans to customers that have refocused there activities out of the nordic region, i.e. the customers are no longer nordic customers  
• 
the sale of loans that are no longer profitable, e.g. due to changes in the regulatory environment or the like  
 
classification and measurement – the sppi test (solely payment of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding) 
for each loan in the group’s banking units, it is assessed if the contractual cash flows are consistent with the sppi test. the principal amount reflects 
the fair value at initial recognition less any subsequent changes, e.g. due to repayment. the interest represents consideration for the time value of money, 
credit risk, other basic lending risks and a margin consistent with basic lending features, only. if the cash flows introduce more than de minimis exposure 
to risk or volatility that is not consistent with basic lending features, the loan is mandatorily recognised at fair value through profit or loss. features that 
are not genuine do not affect the classification. a feature is not genuine if it affects the contractual cash flows only on the occurrence of an event that is 
extremely rare, highly abnormal and very unlikely to occur. 
 
in general, the sppi test of the group’s portfolios of loans covers, for instance, the following elements: 
• 
compensation for the time value of money. for some of the group’s variable-rate loans, the market standard for these loans is that the reset 
frequency and the tenor of the reference rate do not match. it has been assessed that the mismatch does not significantly modify the compensation 
for the time value of money. no loans have interest rates that are leveraged or linked to, for instance, the development in share prices etc. 
• 
prepayment options are consistent with the sppi test, if the prepayment amount represents the principal amount outstanding and accrued interest 
and may include a reasonable compensation for early repayment. this is generally the case with the group’s loans, except loans granted by 
realkredit danmark (see further below). 
• 
extension options are consistent with the sppi test if the cash flows during the extension period represent cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. only very few loans include a contractual right for the customer to extend the loan, and 
for such loans, the interest rate will be updated to the current market rate for such loans. 
• 
compensation for credit risk and other basic lending risks. the interest rate includes a credit margin to compensate the group for the credit risk, 
and it may be fixed initially. the group does not incorporate profit sharing agreements, for example by contractual terms that increase the credit 
margin if the customer’s earnings increase.  
• 
non-recourse features. in general, the group does not grant loans that legally are non-recourse. however, in some cases a financial asset represents 
an investment in particular assets or cash flows in which case the contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding. this could be the case when the group’s claim is limited to specified assets of a debtor or the cash flows from specified 
assets, e.g. related to loans granted to a company/a special purpose entity with limited assets and with no guarantee from the owner/parent 
company. the group only grants such loans if the cash flows from the underlying asset(s) are large compared to the contractual cash flows from 
the loans. therefore, non-recourse-like features are limited and excluded from the assessment. 
• 
non-payment is not considered a breach of contract. the group does not grant loans where non-payment would not constitute a breach of contract. 
 
loans granted under danish mortgage finance law are funded by issuing listed mortgage bonds with matching terms. such loans are granted by the 
realkredit danmark subsidiary only. borrowers may repay such loans by delivering the underlying bonds. this represents an option to prepay at fair value 
that can be both above and below the principal amount plus accrued interest and include other elements than the effect of changes in the relevant 
benchmark interest rate. the loans do not pass the sppi test and are mandatorily recognised at fair value through profit or loss, see further in note g16. 
 
financial instruments in scope of the expected credit loss impairment model in ifrs 9 
impairment charges for expected credit losses apply to all financial assets recognised at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive 
income, lease receivables and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. therefore, the group’s expected credit loss model also 
applies to bond portfolios included in the line item investment securities, except for the bonds that are recognised at fair value through profit or loss.  
 
further, the adjustment for fair value of credit risk on loans granted by realkredit danmark is based on the expected credit loss impairment model in 
ifrs 9. further information can be found in note g16 in the box on accounting policy.

significant increase in credit risk (transfer from stage 1 to stage 2) 
the classification of facilities between stages 1 and 2 for the purpose of calculating expected credit losses depends on whether the credit risk has 
increased significantly since initial recognition. the assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition is performed 
by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the facility and incorporating forward-looking information. a facility is 
transferred from stage 1 to stage 2 based on observed increases in the probability of default: 
• 
for facilities originated below 1% in pd: an increase in the facility’s 12-month pd of at least 0.5 percentage points and a doubling of the facility’s 
lifetime pd since origination. 
• 
for facilities originated above 1% in pd: an increase in the facility’s 12 month pd of 2 percentage points or a doubling of the facility’s lifetime pd 
since origination.  
 
in addition, facilities that are more than 30 days past due are moved to stage 2. 30 days past due is considered a backstop. finally, customers subject to 
forbearance measures are placed in stage 2, if the group, in the most likely outcome, expects no loss, or if the customers are subject to the two-year 
probation period for performing forborne exposures.  
 
stage 3 (credit-impaired facilities) 
a facility is transferred from stage 2 to stage 3 when it becomes credit-impaired. a facility becomes credit-impaired when one or more events that have 
a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows have occurred. this includes observable data about (a) significant financial difficulty of the issuer 
or the borrower; (b) a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event; (c) the borrower, for financial or contractual reasons relating to the 
borrower’s financial difficulty, having been granted a concession that would not otherwise have been considered; (d) it is becoming probable that the 
borrower will enter into bankruptcy or other financial restructuring; and (e) the purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects 
the incurred credit loss. it may not be possible to identify a single individual event – instead, the combined effect of several events may cause financial 
asset to become credit-impaired. credit-impaired facilities are placed in rating category 10 or 11. for customers in rating category 10, the stage 3 
classification applies only to customers where a loss is expected in the most likely scenario. for rating category 11 (default), all facilities are classified 
as stage 3 exposures. 
 
definition of default 
the definition of default used in the measurement of expected credit losses and the assessment to determine movements between stages is consistent 
with the definition of default used for internal credit risk management purposes and is aligned with the crr. as a result, exposures which are considered 
to be in default for regulatory purposes will always be considered stage 3 exposures. this applies both for 90-days-past-due considerations and unlikely-
to-pay factors leading to a regulatory default.  
 
purchased or originated credit-impaired facilities (poci) 
a facility that is credit-impaired at initial recognition is classified as a poci financial asset. this is the case if the financial asset is purchased or originated 
at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses. for such assets, life-time expected credit losses are recognised for the remaining lifetime of 
the asset. in general, the group does not purchase credit-impaired financial assets and the category therefore relates to originated credit-impaired 
facilities, typically originated in relation to forbearance measures.  
  
calculation of expected credit losses 
the expected credit loss is calculated for all individual facilities as a function of the probability of default (pd), the exposure at default (ead) and the loss 
given default (lgd). in general, the group’s ifrs 9 impairment models and parameters draw on the bank’s internal models in order to ensure alignment 
of models across the group. new models and calculations have been developed especially for ifrs 9 purposes, including models for lifetime pd, 
prepayment and forward-looking lgd. all expected credit loss impairment charges are allocated to individual exposures. for significant loans in stage 3, 
the group determines the expected credit losses individually.  
 
expected remaining lifetime 
for most facilities, the expected lifetime is limited to the remaining contractual maturity and is adjusted for expected prepayment. for exposures with 
weak credit quality, the likelihood of prepayment is not included. for exposures that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment and where a 
contractual ability to demand prepayment and cancellation of the undrawn commitment does not limit the group’s exposure to credit losses to the 
contractual notice period, the expected lifetime is the period during which the group expects to be exposed to credit losses. this period is estimated on 
the basis of the normal credit risk management actions. products identified as in scope of an expected lifetime longer than the remaining contractual 
maturity include credit cards, overdraft balances and certain revolving credit facilities.  
 
incorporation of forward-looking information 
the forward-looking elements of the calculation reflect the current unbiased expectations of the bank’s senior management. the process consists of the 
creation of macroeconomic scenarios (base case, upside and downside), including an assessment of the probability of each scenario, by the group’s 
independent macroeconomic research unit in fi&c, the review and sign-off of the scenarios (through the organisation) and a process for adjusting 
scenarios given new information during the quarter. the purpose of using multiple scenarios is to model the non-linear impact of assumptions about 
macroeconomic factors on the expected credit losses. management’s approval of scenarios can include adjustments to the scenarios, probability 
weighting and management overlays to cover the outlook for particular high-risk portfolios which are not provided by the group’s macroeconomists. the 
approved scenarios are used to calculate the impairment levels. technically, the forward-looking information is used directly in the pds through an 
estimate of general changes to the pds and the lgds in the expected credit loss calculation. however, for significant exposures in stage 3, an individual 
assessment of the scenarios, changes to expected credit losses and the related probabilities are performed by senior credit officers. 
 
 
100 danske bank / annual report 2020 
 
notes – danske bank group 
g15. loans at amortised cost continued 
 
the forward-looking information is based on a three year forecast period converging to steady state in year seven. the base case is based on the 
macroeconomic outlook as disclosed in the group’s nordic outlook reports. further information on the macroeconomic scenarios used can be found in 
the risk management notes. 
 
forecasts are produced for the coming three years. after this period, the outlook returns to a steady-state level after a further four years.  
 
write-off policy 
loans considered uncollectible are written off. write-offs are debited to the allowance account. loans are written off once the usual collection procedure 
has been completed and the loss on the individual loan can be calculated. if the full loss is not expected to be realised until after a number of years, for 
example in the event of administration of complex estates, a partial write-off is recognised, reflecting the group’s claim less collateral, estimated dividend 
and other cash flows. 
 
modification 
when a loan is modified the group assesses whether the modification results in derecognition. this depends on whether the changes to the contractual 
cash flows or other contractual terms are significant or not. if the changes are significant, the modification is accounted for as derecognition of the original 
loan and recognition of a new loan. if the changes are not significant, the modification is accounted for as a modification of the original loan. the 
assessment is based on the following considerations: 
• 
the group differentiates between changes in the cash flows or other terms within the original contract and modifications of the contract, i.e. a new 
contract.  
• 
in general, a significant modification is defined as a full credit process, a pricing decision and the signing of a new contract 
• 
an assessment of whether the modification is caused as a forbearance measure or made on commercial terms. 
 
if the financial asset is not derecognised, the original effective interest rate remains unchanged, and the net present value of the changed contractual 
cash flows represents the gross carrying amount of the financial asset after the modification. the difference between the net present value of the original 
contractual cash flows and the modified contractual cash flows is recognised in the income statement as a modification gain or loss.  
 
if the original financial asset is derecognised, a derecognition gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. the derecognition gain or loss 
represents the difference between the carrying amount of the original financial asset (updated to reflect current expected credit losses) and the initial 
carrying amount of the new financial asset plus/minus any cash payments between the parties in relation to the modification. 
 
modifications in the form of forbearance measures include interest reduction schedules, interest only schedules, temporary payment holidays, term 
extensions, cancellation of outstanding fees, waiver of covenant enforcement and debt forgiveness. for modifications that are not significant, the 
modification loss is recognised in the income statement within loan impairment charges. 
 
in terms of stage allocation, a modification that leads to derecognition of the initial loan and recognition of a new loan, the loan will (unless the new loan is 
credit-impaired at initial recognition) be recognised in stage 1 at initial recognition, i.e. the initial credit risk is reset. if the replacing loan is considered an 
amendment to the original loan, the initial credit risk is not reset. loans modified as part of the group’s forbearance policy, where the modification does 
not result in derecognition, the loss allowance on the forborne loans will generally only be measured based on 12-months expected credit losses when 
there is evidence of the borrower’s improved repayment behaviour. when a loan in stage 3 is modified, and the modification results in derecognition, the 
group’s assesses if the new loan is originated credit impaired. the assessment includes factors such as whether the customer’s repayment behaviour 
has improved significantly prior to the modification or not and whether the pricing on the new loan reflects the actual credit risk etc. new loans that are 
originated credit impaired remains under a lifetime ecl calculation for the remaining term of the exposure.

the movements on the allowance account are determined by comparing the classification and amount in the balance sheet at the beginning and the end 
of the year. the table above excludes the allowance account of dkk 4 million (2019: dkk 4 million) relating to bonds at amortised cost or fair value 
through other comprehensive income (all in stage 1). it also excludes the adjustment for credit risk on loans held for sale (loan portfolios within the non-
core segment where the group has entered into sales agreements). for further information on the decomposition of the allowance account on facilities 
in stages 1-3, see the notes on credit risk.

notes – danske bank group 
g16. loans and issued bonds at fair value 
 
the group has two types of portfolios of loans and issued bonds that are measured at fair value through profit or loss. the first portfolio consists of loans 
granted and bonds issued by the subsidiary realkredit danmark, a danish mortgage institution covered by danish mortgage finance law. the other portfolio 
consists of loans and bonds issued by the group’s trading units (fi&c and capital markets in c&i).  
 
accounting policy 
loans granted and bonds issued by realkredit danmark 
loans granted by realkredit danmark have contractual cash flows that are not solely payment of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding. therefore, the loans are mandatorily recognised at fair value through profit or loss. the issued bonds that are funding the loans are 
designated at fair value through profit or loss in order not to create an accounting mismatch. for the issued bonds, changes in fair value attributable to 
the group’s own credit risk is presented in the income statement, as an accounting mismatch would otherwise be introduced. 
 
the fair value of the bonds issued by realkredit danmark is normally defined as their quoted market price. a small number of the issued bonds are 
illiquid, however, and the fair value of these bonds is calculated on the basis of a discounted cash flow valuation technique. the fair value of the loans is 
based on the fair value of the underlying bonds which ensures that changes in the fair value of the interest rate risk on the loans are measured based 
on market implied input. this fair value is adjusted for changes in the fair value of cash flows from the loans that differ from the cash flows from the 
issued bonds. the most important component is the credit risk on the borrowers (covered by the group and not by the bond holders and therefore not 
priced into the price of the issued bonds). 
 
changes in fair value of credit risk etc on the loans 
the ifrs 13 estimate of the fair value of the credit risk on the loans is based the expected credit losses estimated in the models developed in connection 
with the group’s implementation of the expected credit loss impairment model in ifrs 9, including the allocation of loans between stage 1, stage 2 and 
stage 3. the expected credit losses are calculated for all loans as a function of pd, ead and lgd and incorporates forward looking information, see 
further in note g15. the latter reflects managements expectations of expected credit losses and involves multiple scenarios (base case, upside and 
downside), including an assessment of the probability for each scenario.  
 
on top of the expected credit losses, a collective assessment determines the need for further adjustments to reflect other components in the fair value 
measurement, such as an assessment of lifetime expected credit losses for loans in stage 1, an investors risk premium, compensation for 
administrative costs related to the loans and the possibility to increase the margin on the loans if the credit risk etc increases. it is acknowledged that 
the possibility to increase the margin depends on the economic resources of the customers. the possibility to increase the margin is therefore only 
considered in the measurement if it is very likely that the margin can be increased without the customer defaulting. further, the possibility to increase 
the margin is only relevant if it does not give the customer an incentive to “move” to another mortgage institution. therefore, the possibility to increase 
the margin is only relevant for the measurement of loans to customers with neither a relatively high credit risk nor a relatively low credt risk.  
 
the discount rate used to discount the cash flows represents the interest rate on the funding bonds. this is considered to be close to a risk-free interest 
rate. the risk premium is incorporated into the cash flows. the risk premium is assumed to be higher for customers with high credit risk than for 
customers with low credit risk. further, the adjustments for changes in the fair value of the credit risk and other components cannot increase the value 
of a loan (the adjustment cannot be positive).  
 
other loans and issued bonds measured at fair value through profit or loss 
the loans in the group’s trading units (fi&c and capital markets in c&i) are managed and their performance reported on a fair value basis and the 
loans are under ifrs 9 mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss. in order not to introduce an accounting mismatch by measuring the 
financial assets in the trading units at fair value through profit or loss and the financial liabilities at amortised cost, the financial liabilities in the trading 
units are designated at fair value through profit or loss with fair value changes attributable to the group’s own credit risk presented in other 
comprehensive income.

(c) further explanation on loans granted and bonds issued by realkredit danmark  
each loan granted by realkredit danmark is funded by issuing listed mortgage bonds with matching characteristics (e.g. amount outstanding, reference 
interest rate, term and currency). the borrower may repay the loan by delivering the underlying bonds to realkredit danmark. 
 
the loans are held in a business model being similar to other loans in the group’s banking units, ie. the business model under ifrs 9 is ‘held to collect’. the 
customers’ right to prepay a loan by delivering the underlying bonds represents an option to prepay at fair value. under this prepayment option, the prepayment 
amount can be both above and below the principal amount plus accrued interest. changes in the fair value of the underlying bonds include other elements 
than the effect of changes in the relevant benchmark interest rate and the prepayment option is therefore not consistent with the sppi test in ifrs 9 and are 
mandatorily measured at fvpl.  
 
to eliminate the accounting mismatch that would exist if the loans are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the issued bonds at amortised cost, 
the issued bonds are designated at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option for financial liabilities in ifrs 9. as the fair value of the loans is 
based on the fair value of the issued bonds, fair value changes of the issued bonds are offset by fair value changes of the loans, including the changes related 
to the fair value of the own credit risk of the issued bonds. for example, if the credit quality of the bonds worsens the fair value of the liability decreases and 
the fair value of the loans also decreases. therefore, fair value changes of own credit risk on the issued bonds are recognised in the income statement, as an 
accounting mismatch would otherwise be created if changes in own credit risk were recognised in other comprehensive income.  
 
the value of the loans is affected by changes in the credit risk on the loans. in 2020, the group recognised dkk 340 million regarding changes in the credit 
risk on loans at fair value (2019: dkk 262 million) see note g11. at the end of 2020, the accumulated changes in the credit risk amounted to dkk 3,094 
million (2019: dkk 3,182 million). the amounts are determined as the amount of the change in fair value that is not attributable to changes in market 
conditions that give rise to market risk, with the latter being represented by the fair value of the funding issued bonds. the group does not use credit derivatives 
or similar instruments to mitigate the exposure to credit risk. 
 
the holding of own mortgage bonds includes pre-issued bonds of dkk 25 billion (2019: dkk 25 billion) used for flexlån® refinancing in january 2021 and 
bonds of dkk 39 billion (2019: dkk 41 billion) that relate to investments under insurance contracts, pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts 
where most of the risk is assumed by customers and most of the return on the assets accrues to customers. 
 
the nominal value of bonds issued by realkredit danmark equals the amount to be redeemed on maturity.

(c) further explanation on loans granted and bonds issued by realkredit danmark  
each loan granted by realkredit danmark is funded by issuing listed mortgage bonds with matching characteristics (e.g. amount outstanding, reference 
interest rate, term and currency). the borrower may repay the loan by delivering the underlying bonds to realkredit danmark. 
 
the loans are held in a business model being similar to other loans in the group’s banking units, ie. the business model under ifrs 9 is ‘held to collect’. the 
customers’ right to prepay a loan by delivering the underlying bonds represents an option to prepay at fair value. under this prepayment option, the prepayment 
amount can be both above and below the principal amount plus accrued interest. changes in the fair value of the underlying bonds include other elements 
than the effect of changes in the relevant benchmark interest rate and the prepayment option is therefore not consistent with the sppi test in ifrs 9 and are 
mandatorily measured at fvpl.  
 
to eliminate the accounting mismatch that would exist if the loans are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the issued bonds at amortised cost, 
the issued bonds are designated at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option for financial liabilities in ifrs 9. as the fair value of the loans is 
based on the fair value of the issued bonds, fair value changes of the issued bonds are offset by fair value changes of the loans, including the changes related 
to the fair value of the own credit risk of the issued bonds. for example, if the credit quality of the bonds worsens the fair value of the liability decreases and 
the fair value of the loans also decreases. therefore, fair value changes of own credit risk on the issued bonds are recognised in the income statement, as an 
accounting mismatch would otherwise be created if changes in own credit risk were recognised in other comprehensive income.  
 
the value of the loans is affected by changes in the credit risk on the loans. in 2020, the group recognised dkk 340 million regarding changes in the credit 
risk on loans at fair value (2019: dkk 262 million) see note g11. at the end of 2020, the accumulated changes in the credit risk amounted to dkk 3,094 
million (2019: dkk 3,182 million). the amounts are determined as the amount of the change in fair value that is not attributable to changes in market 
conditions that give rise to market risk, with the latter being represented by the fair value of the funding issued bonds. the group does not use credit derivatives

g16. loans and issued bonds at fair value continued 
 
fair value adjustment for the credit risk on issued mortgage bonds, i.e. own credit risk, is calculated on the basis of the option-adjusted spread (oas) to 
government bond yields or, for variable-rate loans, the swap rate. the calculation incorporates maturity, nominal holdings and oas sensitivity. as a number 
of estimates are made, the calculation is subject to uncertainty. 
 
in 2020, the danish mortgage bond yield spread narrowed, and consequently the fair value of issued mortgage bonds increased about dkk 1 billion. in 2019, 
the danish mortgage bond yield spread also narrowed, and consequently the fair value of issued mortgage bonds increased about dkk 2.1 billion. in 
comparison with the fair value measured at the time of issue of the bonds, the fair value had increased about dkk 5.0 billion at the end of 2020 (2019: an 
increase of about dkk 4.7 billion). net profit and equity remain unaffected because the spread narrowing increased the fair value of mortgage loans 
correspondingly. 
 
fair value adjustment for the credit risk on issued mortgage bonds may also be calculated on the basis of changes in similar aaa-rated mortgage bonds 
offered by other danish issuers. the market for such bonds is characterised by an absence of measurable price differences between bonds with similar 
characteristics from different issuers. using this method, no fair value adjustment for credit risk in 2019 or the period since issuance has been required. 
 
(d) further explanation on loans, deposits and issued bonds by the group’s trading units 
the loans in the group’s trading units (fi&c and capital markets in c&i) are managed and their performance reported on a fair value basis. the loans are 
mandatorily recognised at fair value through profit or loss as the business model is neither ‘held to collect’ nor ‘held to collect and sell’. the loans consist 
primarily of reverse transactions and short-term loans. in order not to introduce an accounting mismatch, the financial liabilities in the tranding units are 
designated at fair value through profit or loss, using the fair value option in ifrs 9.  
 
the financial liabilities consist of issued bonds (certificates of deposits and commercial papers) and deposits (including repo transactions) with a maturity no 
longer than six months in general. fair value changes attributable to the group’s own credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income. during 2020, 
changes in fair value attributable to the group’s own credit risk recognised in other comprehensive income amounted to dkk 0 million (2019: dkk 0 million). 
in the balance sheet, deposits in the trading units are presented together with other deposits. the amount that the group would be contractually required to 
pay at maturity amounts to dkk 8,107 million (2019: dkk 6,779 million) for bonds issued by the group’s trading units.

g18. assets and liabilities under insurance contracts 
 
assets under insurance contracts comprise assets earmarked for policyholders because most of the return accrues to policyholders. as the assets can 
be used only for payment of insurance liabilities, they are presented as a single line in the balance sheet. liabilities under insurance contracts comprise 
primarily life insurance provisions regarding average rate insurance contracts and obligations for guaranteed benefits under unit-linked insurance 
contracts. assets include shares and bonds issued by the group. the holdings of those assets are deducted from equity or eliminated. consequently, the 
value of liabilities under insurance contracts exceeds the value of assets under insurance contracts.  
 
accounting policy  
assets include financial assets, investment property, tangible assets and associates. the financial assets are managed on a fair value basis with no 
short-term profit taking. the business model for managing the assets is therefore neither ‘held to collect’ nor ‘held to collect and sell’ and the financial 
assets are therefore mandatorily recognised at fair value through profit or loss. the valuation technique used matches the group’s accounting policy 
for similar assets.  
 
recognition of life insurance provisions is based on actuarial computations of the present value of expected benefits for each insurance contract. the 
accounting for insurance liabilities follows the requirements in the danish fsa’s executive order on financial reports for insurance companies etc.  
 
life insurance provisions include guaranteed benefits, a risk margin and individual bonus potentials.  
 
guaranteed benefits comprise obligations to pay guaranteed benefits to policyholders. these obligations are calculated as the present value of current 
guaranteed benefits plus the present value of expected future administrative expenses less the present value of future premiums. the actuarial 
computations rely on assumptions about a number of variables, including mortality and disability rates, and the expected frequency of surrenders and 
conversions into paid-up policies. the risk margin is the expected market payment to an acquirer of a policy in return for assuming the risk that the 
payment obligations under the policy deviate from the present value of the best estimate of the cash flows. the risk margin is determined using a margin 
on mortality intensity and intensity relating to conversions into paid-up policies and surrenders. 
 
policyholders’ share of the technical basis for insurance policies with a bonus entitlement not yet allocated to the individual policyholder is recognised 
in the collective bonus potential. individual bonus potentials are calculated for the portfolio of insurance policies with bonus entitlement as the difference 
between the value of a policyholder’s savings and the present value of guaranteed benefits under the policy. 
 
liabilities also depend on the discount yield curve, which is fixed on the basis of an european insurance and occupational pension authority (eiopa) 
yield curve and a volatility adjustment, also set by eiopa. 
 
provisions for unit-linked insurance contracts are measured at fair value on the basis of each contract’s share of the earmarked assets and of the 
benefits guaranteed in the contract.

g18. assets and liabilities under insurance contracts continued 
 
(c) further explanation  
the measurement of insurance liabilities is based on the requirements in the danish fsa’s executive order on financial reports for insurance companies 
etc. and is harmonised to the measurement under the solvency ii framework.  
 
below the different components of liabilities related to insurance contracts are explained. 
 
life insurance provisions 
life insurance provisions comprise obligations towards policyholders to 
• 
pay guaranteed benefits 
• 
pay bonuses over time on agreed premiums not yet due 
• 
pay bonuses on premiums and other payments due 
• 
include a risk margin 
 
recognition of life insurance provisions is based on actuarial computations of the present value of expected future benefits for each insurance contract 
using the discount rate at the balance sheet date. these computations rely on assumptions about a number of variables, including mortality and disability 
rates, and the expected frequency of surrenders and conversions into paid-up policies. estimates of future mortality rates are based on danish fsa 
benchmarks, while other estimates are based on empirical data from danica pension’s own portfolio of insurance contracts. estimates are updated 
regularly. the life insurance provisions also include a risk margin. obligations for guaranteed benefits are calculated as the present value of current 
guaranteed benefits plus the present value of expected future administrative expenses less the present value of future premiums. 
 
insurance obligations are calculated by discounting the expected cash flows using a discount yield curve and a volatility adjustment, both defined by eiopa 
as part of the solvency ii rules. at 1 january 2019, eiopa changed its method of calculating the danish volatility adjustment (va) of the discount curve. 
as a result of the changed methodology and update of underlying parameters, the va was reduced by 12 basis points. the financial effect of the changed 
discount curve was a dkk 1.5 billion reduction of the buffers and a reduction of the profit before tax of dkk 140 million and dkk 109 million after tax. 
 
collective bonus potential 
provisions for the collective bonus potential are the policyholders’ part of the value of the bonus entitlement not yet allocated to the individual 
policyholders. 
 
provisions for unit-linked insurance contracts 
provisions are measured at fair value on the basis of each contract’s share of the earmarked assets and of the benefits guaranteed in the contract. 
 
profit margin 
the profit margin is the present value of the future profit on contracts expected to be recognised in the income statement concurrently with the provision 
of insurance cover and any other benefits under the contract. for products where life insurance and health and accident insurance are written together, 
these are measured collectively. accordingly, the profit margin on the customers’ savings component is reduced by an amount similar to the provision 
for losses on health and accident insurance that can be included in the profit margin before the reduction. 
 
other technical provisions 
 
other technical provisions includes outstanding claims provisions for non-life insurance contracts, unearned premiums provisions, a risk margin for non-
life insurance contracts and provisions for bonuses and premium discounts. the item includes the provision for health and accident insurance contracts. 
 
other liabilities 
other liabilities includes the portion of danica pension’s other liabilities assumed by customers. other types of liabilities are measured in accordance 
with the group’s accounting policies for such liability types.

g19. intangible assets 
 
intangible assets consist of goodwill and customer relations taken over on the acquisition of undertakings. further, acquired and internally developed 
software is recognised as an asset if certain criteria are fulfilled.  
 
the group did not make any acquisions of undertakings in 2020 and in 2019. in 2020, no impairment loss on goodwill was recognised. in 2019, the 
group recognised impairment charges of dkk 1.6 billion on goodwill, see further below. 
 
accounting policy 
goodwill

model applied in the goodwill impairment tests for 2020 and 2019  
the impairment test compares the recoverable amount and the carrying amount for each cash-generating unit. the recoverable amount is represented 
by the present value of expected future cash flows (value in use). the special debt structure of financial institutions requires the use of a discounted 
dividend (equity) model to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, as the interest on lending and borrowings is included as part of the 
cash flows.  
 
the carrying amount for each cash-generating unit is the aggregate of the cash-generating unit’s goodwill and allocated capital. the cash-generating 
unit’s allocated capital is derived using the group’s capital allocation framework. the capital framework is based on a regulatory approach to identify the 
individual business unit’s capital consumption and is in accordance with the group’s capital targets. the capital framework includes the impact from 
implementation of crr2/c21 and higher regulatory capital requirements from basel iv. in the impairment test for 2020, the capital target was reduced 
from 16% to 15% in 2022 and 14.5% from 2023 in accordance with the current capital allocation model. this led to a decrease in the capital allocated 
to the cash-generating units compared to the impaiment test for 2019. 
 
for each cash generating unit, the expected future cash flow is based on approved strategies and earnings estimates for the budget period representing 
the first five years. future cash flows are budgeted based on actual performance in 2020 to take into account the impact of the corona crisis. earnings 
are expected to normalise from 2022. for the terminal period, the steady state normalised level of earnings (expected dividend) is expected to grow at a 
constant growth rate equal to expected real gdp growth. cash flow estimates are post-tax, and the risks of the individual cash-generating units are 
reflected in the estimated earnings. accordingly, the risk-adjusted cash flows carry a similar risk profile. the estimated cash flows are discounted at the 
group’s risk-adjusted required rates of return post-tax. 
 
cash generating units with goodwill 
corporates & institutions, general banking 
in 2007, danske bank acquired the shares of the sampo bank group and incorporated its banking activities into the business structure of danske bank’s 
banking activities. in the beginning of 2011, general banking was separated from banking activities into an independent unit, resulting in reallocation of 
goodwill to the unit. as a result of organisational changes in 2012, general banking became part of corporates & institutions as a separate cash 
generating unit. 
 
corporates & institutions, fi&c and capital markets 
the trading activities of sampo bank were incorporated into the business structure of danske markets in 2007. as a result of organisational changes in 
2012, danske markets became part of corporates & institutions as a separate cash generating unit. in 2015, the unit was renamed to fi&c and capital 
markets. 
 
wealth management, danske capital 
the wealth management activities of sampo bank were incorporated into the business structure of danske capital in 2007. in addition to the acquisition 
of sampo bank, goodwill recognised by danske capital is attributable to a number of smaller acquisitions. as a result of organisational changes in 2016, 
danske capital became part of wealth management as a separate cash generating unit. 
 
wealth management, danica pension 
this includes the acquisition of danica pensionsforsikring (formerly seb pension danmark) in 2018 by the subsidiary danica pension. through the 
acquisition of danica pensionsforsikring, the group increased its presence in the danish pension market, strengthened its innovation capacity and offered 
customers even better pension and insurance solutions. in 2019, danica pensionsforsikring was merged with danica pension. after the merger and 
integration of danica pensionsforsikring into danica pension, this goodwill is tested on the cash generating unit consisting of danica pension’s danish 
activities. 
 
key assumptions for goodwill impairment tests  
discount rate 
the discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows was changed from 8% after tax in the 2019 test to 7% after tax in 
the 2020 test after updating data used to calculate the discount rate. the discount rate has been determined on the basis of the capital asset pricing 
model and comprises a risk-free interest rate, the market risk premium and a factor covering the systematic market risk (beta factor). the values for the 
risk-free interest rate, the market risk premium and the beta factor are determined and updated yearly using external sources of information. the 
reduction in the discount rate reflects the reduction in the risk free interest rate and the market risk premium during 2020. the group applies the same 
discount rate to all cash-generating units, as the risks of the individual cash-generating units are reflected in their estimated cash flows.

cash flows in the terminal period 
cash flows in the terminal period reflect net earnings (dividend) in the preceding year growing at a constant rate. the growth estimates are determined 
on the basis of danske research’s forecasts of real gdp growth for the relevant markets. for danske capital, the assumed growth rate in the terminal 
period is 1.4% (2019: 1.4%), for danica pension the rate is 0% (2019: 0%), and for general banking as well as for fi&c and capital markets, the rate is 
1.5% (2019: 1.6%). around 84% of the net present value of future cash flows is expected to be generated in the terminal period (2019: 74%). 
 
corporates & institutions general banking 
earnings are primarily affected by expectations for the interest level and its resulting effect on net interest income, as well as expectations for net fee 
income, on operating expenses and on credit losses.  
 
the interest rate levels used in the impairment test are based on danske research’s expectations for developments in overnight money market interest 
rates. the interest rates are expected to be positive from 2025 (2019: 2024). when interest rate levels increase, the return on allocated capital will 
increase. earnings on lending and deposits depend on the growth in lending and deposits and on changes in lending and deposit margins. lending and 
deposit volumes increased in 2020 driven by the corona crisis and are expected to decline in 2021, where after a normal underlying growth is expected. 
expectations for growth in lending and deposits reflect danske bank’s budgets for the first years and subsequently danske research’s forecasts for real 
gdp growth. as lending and deposit margins are assumed to be constant regardless of the interest rate level, earnings from lending and deposits are 
not particularly sensitive to changes in the interest rate level. 
 
fee income is expected to continue to increase with the growth in gdp over the following years, however from a lower level due to the impact from the 
corona crisis. 
 
from 2021-2023 operating expenses is expected to increase per year based on projections. 2024 and 2025 is based on expected wage inflation and 
other costs with general inflation. in addition there is an underlying cost increase in allocated cost from group functions due to mainly regulatory and 
compliance related activities. 
 
the expectations for credit losses are for the budget period based on danske bank’s estimates for each year, reflecting historical data adjusted to reflect 
the current situation, including the impact from the corona crisis. credit losses are expected to normalise from 2022. subsequently, expected credit 
losses are kept constant and reflect historical data for long-term annual credit losses. 
 
corporates & institutions fi&c and capital markets 
earnings are primarily affected by expectations for net fee income, net trading income and costs. 
 
from 2021-2023, fee and trading income are forecasted with actual projections, whereas 2024 and 2025 has been forecasted with the growth in gdp. 
projections are based on expected fee and trading income for 2020 to reflect the impact of the corona crisis. income is impacted by interest on calculated 
equity and capital cost. interest on calculated equity is calculated based on the overnight money market interest rate and the allocated capital. interest 
on calculated equity changes from an expense to an income from 2025 (2019: 2024) as the overnight money market interest rate is expected to turn 
positive in that year. capital costs are expected to increase driven by higher capital consumption and funding costs. the reasons for the higher funding 
costs is replacment of previous issued senior funding with new senior funding at a higher price. 
 
from 2021-2023 operating expenses is expected to increase per year based on projections. in 2024-2025 is based on expected wage inflation and 
other costs with general inflation. in addition there is an underlying cost increase in allocated cost from group functions due to mainly regulatory and 
compliance related activities. 
 
wealth management, danske capital 
earnings at danske capital depend primarily on the management fee on assets under management. expected cash flows therefore depend on 
expectations for changes in assets under management and the average margin on those assets. for the period until the terminal period, changes in 
assets under management depend on net sales and on the accumulation of market returns on the assets. assets under management declined in 2020 
due to the impact of the corona crisis affecting market value and also the market actvitiy. asset under management is expected to recover the lost ground 
in 2021, after which the development is expected to normalise from 2022. the average margin on assets under management is expected to be 0.32% 
(2019: 0.34%). the budgeted average margin on assets under management is slightly lower than the realised margin for 2020. the decrease in the 
average margin is among others driven by the allocation of assets between shares and bonds in funds and the allocation between active and passive 
managed funds. all assumptions reflect management’s expectations.  
 
wealth management, danica pension 
earnings are budgeted based on specific management forecast and projections, which includes expected reserves and provisions, fees and margins, 
operating cost base and effects from planned management actions. future cash flows are budgeted taking into account the impact of the corona crisis 
on income and solvency capital requirements. management actions mainly includes capital optimisation initiatives based on capital planning projections. 
for financial years after the forecast period, cash flows are projected based on the last year in the forecast period adjusted for an expected growth of 0% 
(2019: 0%), the growth rate reflects the expected long-term growth rate for life insurance.

sensitivity analysis 
for general banking, the excess value (the amount by which the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill) amounts to dkk 12,812 
million (2019: dkk 2,482 million). the increase in excess value is mainly due to the change in the discount rate, but also lower allocated capital because 
of reduction of the capital requirement and higher net interest income. net interest income is expected to increase due to increasing deposit and lending 
volumes and more positive outlook for overnight money market interest rates. if the growth in the terminal period is reduced from 1.5% to -3.0% (2019: 
from 1.6% to -0.6%) or the discount rate is increased from 7.0% to 10.2% (2019: increased from 8.0% to 8.7%) the excess value would be zero. 
 
for fi&c and capital markets, the excess value amounts to dkk 5,282 million (2019: dkk 0 million). the increase in excess value is driven by the lower 
discount rate. lower costs as a result of redundancies and lower allocated capital because of reduction of the capital requirement have also contributed 
to the higher excess value. if the discount rate is increased from 7% to 8.4% or the growth in the terminal period is reduced from 1.5% to -0.3%, the 
excess value would be zero. 
 
for danske capital, the excess value amounts to dkk 1,087 million (2019: dkk 1,069 million). the excess value is on same level as last year because 
the reduction of the discount rate countered the negative impact for of the expected reduction of the average margin on assets under management from 
0.34% in the 2019 test to 0.32% in the 2020 test. the excess value is particularly sensitive to the assumption about the average margin on assets 
under management, as a further decrease from 0.32% to 0.22% would imply that the excess value is zero (2019: from 0.34% to 0.25%). for the other 
assumptions, the excess value would be zero if the discount rate was increased by 2.7 percentage points to 9.7% (2019: 3.5 percentage points to 
11.5%), or the growth rate in the terminal period is lowered from 1.4% to -2.5% (2019: from 1.4% to -4.3%). 
 
for danica pension, the excess value amounts to dkk 1,500 million (2019: dkk 0 million). the excess value increased mainly because of the lower 
discount rate. the excess value is particularly sensitive to regulatory driven increase in the solvency capital requirements. sensitivity calculations show 
that an increase of the solvency capital requirement of dkk 1 billion at the end of 2020 would reduce the excess value by dkk 0.9 billion. if the growth 
in the terminal period is reduced from 0% to -1.0% or the discount rate is increased from 7% to 8%, an impairment loss of dkk 0.3 billion  would have 
been recognised.

accounting policy  
amounts due to credit institutions and central banks and deposits in the group’s trading units (fi&c and capital markets in c&i) are designated at fair 
value through profit or loss. however, the amount of the change in fair value attributable to the group’s own credit risk is recognised in other

g20. due to credit institutions and central banks and deposits 
 
amounts due to credit institutions and central banks and deposits also include amounts received under repo transactions (sales of securities which the 
group agrees to repurchase at a later date). such transactions are presented as collateralised borrowings.  
 
accounting policy  
amounts due to credit institutions and central banks and deposits in the group’s trading units (fi&c and capital markets in c&i) are designated at fair 
value through profit or loss. however, the amount of the change in fair value attributable to the group’s own credit risk is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. 
 
all other balances are measured at amortised cost. if fixed-rate deposits are hedged effectively by derivatives, the fair value of the hedged interest rate 
risk is added to the amortised cost of the liabilities.

(c) further explanation on balances designated at fair value through profit or loss 
any changes in the fair value that is attributable to changes in the group’s own credit risk of the liabilities are recognised in other comprehensive income. as 
the deposits are collateralised and/or with a short maturity, no change in the fair value is attributable to changes in the group’s own credit risk. the amount 
that the group would be contractually required to pay at maturity amounts to dkk 93.4 billion (2019: dkk 79.9 billion) for due to credit institutions and 
central banks and dkk 150.8 billion (2019: dkk 184.8 billion) for deposits.

g21. tax  
 
tax assets and liabilities are divided into current and deferred tax in this note. current tax relates to expected tax to be paid on the profit for the year, whereas 
deferred tax relates to temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the balance sheet. further, this note 
gives an overview of the group’s tax expense for the year and the effective tax rate broken down by country. since 2009, danske bank has been part of 
international joint taxation. this automatically runs for ten years and thus expires in 2019. the board of directors decided not to enter into a new 10-year 
period. 
 
accounting policy 
current tax 
current tax assets and liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet as the estimated tax payable on the profit for the year adjusted for prepaid tax and 
prior-year tax payables and receivables. tax assets and liabilities are offset if the group has a legally enforceable right to set off such assets and 
liabilities and intends either to settle the assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 
 
deferred tax 
deferred tax on all temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts is accounted for in accordance with 
the balance sheet liability method. deferred tax is measured on the basis of enacted or substantially enacted tax regulations and rates that are 
applicable in the relevant countries at the time the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. changes in deferred tax as a result of changes 
in tax rates are recognised in the income statement on the basis of expected cash flows.the group does not recognise deferred tax on temporary 
differences between the tax base and the carrying amounts of goodwill not subject to amortisation for tax purposes and other items if the temporary 
differences arose at the time of acquisition without effect on net profit or taxable income. if the tax base may be calculated according to several sets of 
tax regulations, deferred tax is measured in accordance with the regulations that apply to the use of the asset or settlement of the liability as planned 
by management. tax assets arising from unused tax losses are only recognised if it is expected that such tax losses can be offset against tax on future 
profit in the next five years. deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to the same tax jurisdiction, a legally enforceable right to offset 
exists and the group intends to settle on a net basis. 
 
current and deferred tax is calculated on the profit for the year, and adjustments of prior-year tax charges are recognised in the income statement. tax 
on items recognised under other comprehensive income is recognised under other comprehensive income. similarly, tax on items recognised in equity 
is recognised in equity. when uncertainty over tax treatment exists, the uncertainty is reflected by using either the most likely outcome (if the possible 
outcomes are binary or are concentrated on one value) or the expected value, probability weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes (if there is 
a range of possible outcomes that are neither binary nor concentrated on one value).

recognition of deferred tax requires management to assess the probability and amount of future profit. deferred tax assets arising from unused tax 
losses are recognised to the extent that such losses can be offset against tax on future profit in the next five years. the tax base of unrecognised tax 
loss carry-forwards, relating primarily to the group’s banking operations in ireland, amounted to dkk 2.9 billion (2019: dkk 2.9 billion).  
 
in 2019 the board of directors decided not to enter into a new 10-year period. the expire of the international joint taxation is expected to lead to a tax 
payment of dkk 576 million, however, the final tax payment is subject to uncertainty as it involves the estimation of the fair value of foreign units with tax 
losses deducted in the joint taxation. in 2019 the deferred tax liability for recapture of tax loss from international joint taxation of dkk 5,806 million was 
reversed leading to an accounting income of dkk 5,230 million. 
 
in 2019, a provision for deferred tax of dkk 1,096 million has been recognised related to financial instruments measured at amortised cost. the 
provision is included under the line item provisions for obligations in the table.

notes – danske bank group 
g22. issued bonds 
 
the issued bonds presented in this note consist of preferred senior, non-preferred senior and subordinated bonds issued by the group, with the exception of 
additional tier 1 capital accounted for as equity. note g16 provides more information about issued bonds measured at fair value through profit or loss and 
note g25 provides more information about additional tier 1 capital accounted for as equity.  
 
preferred senior bonds are presented under the balance sheet item issued bonds at amortised cost, while non-preferred senior and subordinated bonds are 
presented as separate line items in the balance sheet. non-preferred senior bonds rank senior to subordindated debt and junior to other debt. subordinated 
bonds are liabilities in the form of subordinated loan capital and other capital instruments which, in case of the group’s voluntary or compulsory winding-up, 
will not be repaid until the claims of its ordinary and non-preferred senior creditors have been met. subordinated bonds include additional tier 1 capital that 
converts into a variable number of ordinary shares if the common equity tier 1 capital ratio falls below 7% for danske bank a/s or danske bank group (the 
trigger event). the number of shares the additional tier 1 capital could potentially convert into is a function of the share price at the time of conversion, 
however, minimised to usd 23.97 per share (a maximum of 62.6 million shares for the outstanding amount of the capital of usd 1.5 billion). this capital 
utilises 70% of the board of directors’ authorisation to issue shares without pre-emption rights. for further information on the group’s additional tier 1 
capital, see note g25.  
 
accounting policy 
issued bonds, both senior, non-preferred senior and subordinated bonds, are at initial recognition measured at fair value less transaction costs and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost plus the fair value of the hedged interest rate risk. interest income is recognised according to the effective 
interest rate method, including amortisation of any difference between the amount received on issue and the redemption amount.  
 
the group issues perpetual bonds with discretionary interest payments that fulfil the requirements for additional tier 1 capital under the capital 
requirements regulation (crr). if a trigger event occurs, those bonds must be either written down temporarily or converted into a variable number of 
ordinary shares, depending on the terms of the individual bond issue. bonds that convert into a variable number of ordinary shares are accounted for 
as liabilities, while bonds that are temporarily written down are accounted for as equity. for liability accounted bonds, the interest expense is recognised 
in the income statement, i.e. the bonds are accounted for as liabilities in their entirety. 
 
the yield on some issued bonds depends on an index that is not closely linked to the bonds’ financial characteristics, for example an equity or commodity 
index. such embedded derivatives are bifurcated and measured at fair value in the trading portfolio.

g23. assets held for sale  
 
assets held for sale includes assets that fall under ifrs 5. in the balance sheet, assets held for sale are presented under other assets. 
 
accounting policy 
assets held for sale and liabilities in disposal groups 
assets held for sale are tangible assets and disposal groups of assets actively marketed for sale and for which a sale is expected to occur within 12 
months. a disposal group is a group of assets that will be disposed of in a single transaction and includes any directly associated liabilities. a disposal 
group includes for example companies (subsidiaries) taken over under non-performing loan agreements. further, loans that are marketed for sale are 
transferred to assets held for sale. the loans are written down to their expected selling price.  
 
when significant, assets held for sale and liabilities in disposable groups held for sale are presented separately in the balance sheet.  
 
tangible assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount at the time of reclassification and their fair value less expected costs 
to sell and are no longer depreciated. for disposal groups, the net assets in the disposal group is remeasured at the lower of the carrying amount of the 
net assets in the disposal group at the time of reclassification and fair value less expected cost to sell.  
 
if a disposal group of assets and liabilities represents a separate major line of business (typically a reportable segment) or a geographical area of 
operation or is a subisidiary acquired exlusively with a view of resale, it is presented as a discontinued operation. for a discontinued operation, net profit 
is presented as a single item ‘net profit from discontinued operations’ in the income statement, i.e. no longer included as income and expenses from 
the group’s continuing operations.

g24. other assets and other liabilities  
 
the group uses quantitative and qualitative materiality considerations when aggregating line items in the balance sheet that are not considered 
individually material. such line items are presented under other assets or other liabilities and consist of assets and liabilities in disposal groups, net 
assets or net liabilities in defined benefit pension plans, investment property, tangible assets, right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities and holdings 
in associates. 
 
the group uses clean pricing of financial instruments, and accrued interest is therefore included in other assets and other liabilities. in addition, 
prepayments and accrued income and expenses are included under other assets and other liabilities. other staff commitments includes provisions for 
holiday payments, variable remuneration, severance pay etc. the provisions recognised represent the compensation that the employee has earned and 
that is expected to be paid to the employee.

when the group has entered into defined benefit pension plans, the amounts payable are recognised on the basis of an actuarial computation of the 
present value of expected benefits. the present value is calculated on the basis of expected future trends in salaries and interest rates, the time of 
retirement, mortality rates and other factors. the present value of pension benefits less the fair value of pension assets is recognised as a pension 
obligation for each plan under other liabilities. if the net amount of a defined benefit pension plan is positive and may be repaid to the group or reduce 
its future contributions to the plan, the net amount is recognised under other assets. the discount rate is determined by reference to yields on high-
quality corporate bonds with terms matching the terms of the pension obligations. 
 
right of use lease assets and lease liabilities  
the group recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date, for all lease agreements, that the group has entered into as 
lessee, exept short-term leases and leases of low value asset. the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future payments from 
lease components, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate for the individual lease. the lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing 
the carrying amount, to reflect interest and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. furher lease liabilities are changed 
when reameasurements are needed, corresponding adjustment is the related right-of-use asset. gain or loss from a lease modification, not accounted 
for as a separate lease, is recognised in profit and loss. the initial right-of-use asset comprise the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, 
lease payments made at or before the commencement day, initial direct costs and costs to restore the underlying asset. the right-of-use asset are 
subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. the right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period 
of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying asset. when the group is an intermediate lessor, the group accounts for the head lease and the 
sublease as two separate contracts. the sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the 
head lease.  
 
investment property 
investment property is real property, including real property let under operating leases, which the group owns for the purpose of receiving rent and/or 
obtaining capital gains. real property with both domicile (occupied by the group’s support, administrative and back-office functions) and investment 
property elements is allocated proportionately to the two categories if the elements are separately sellable. if that is not the case, such real property is 
classified as investment property if the group occupies less than 10% of the total floorage. investment property is recognised at fair value. fair value 
adjustments and rental income are recognised under other income. real property taken over by the group under non-performing loan agreements that 
is expected to be sold within 12 months of classification is valued in accordance with the principles used for investment property but presented as 
assets held for sale. 
 
tangible assets 
tangible assets include domicile property and plant and equipment. plant and equipment cover equipment, vehicles, furniture, fixtures and leasehold 
improvements. tangible assets also include lease assets, i.e. assets let under operating leases, except real property. lease assets includes cars, lorries 
and equipement. tangible assets are measured at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful life. the estimated useful life is 20-50 years for 
domicile property, 3-10 years for plant and equipment and three years for lease assets. depreciation charges are recognised under operating expenses. 
 
tangible assets are tested for impairment if indications of impairment exist. an impaired asset is written down to its recoverable amount, which is the 
higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. 
 
loan commitments and guarantees 
the group issues a number of loan commitments and guarantees. such exposures are subject to impairment for excepted credit losses. further 
information can be found in note g15. 
 
other provisions, including lititgations 
provisions for other obligations, such as lawsuits, are recognised if the obligation is likely to result in a payment obligation and the amount can be 
measured reliably. liabilities are recognised at the present value of expected payments.

g24. other assets and other liabilities  
 
the group uses quantitative and qualitative materiality considerations when aggregating line items in the balance sheet that are not considered 
individually material. such line items are presented under other assets or other liabilities and consist of assets and liabilities in disposal groups, net 
assets or net liabilities in defined benefit pension plans, investment property, tangible assets, right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities and holdings 
in associates. 
 
the group uses clean pricing of financial instruments, and accrued interest is therefore included in other assets and other liabilities. in addition, 
prepayments and accrued income and expenses are included under other assets and other liabilities. other staff commitments includes provisions for 
holiday payments, variable remuneration, severance pay etc. the provisions recognised represent the compensation that the employee has earned and 
that is expected to be paid to the employee.

(a) further explanation other assets  
investment property is recognised at fair value through profit or loss under other income. information on the method used to determine the fair value of 
investment properties is provided in note g34. 
 
right-of-use lease assets includes domicile property of dkk 3,938 million) (2019: dkk 4,650 million) and other tangible assets of dkk 881 million 
(2019: dkk 984 million). the depreciation charge is respectively dkk 731 million (2019: dkk 730 million) and dkk 111 million (2019: dkk 109 
million). the interest expense on the corresponding lease liability is dkk 76 million (2019: dkk 83 million). there has been no significant impairment 
losses of the right-of-use lease assets in 2020 and 2019. 
 
 
tangible assets consist primarily of lease assets (where the group acts as lessor). further, it includes domicile property (not held for sale) amounting to 
dkk 140 million (2019: dkk 179 million). if indications of impairment exist, the properties are written down to the lower of the carrying amount and its 
value in use determined on the basis of the rate of return used for investment property. note g33 provides more information. there was no write-down 
in 2020, nor in 2019. the fair value of the properties was dkk 286 million (2019: dkk 324 million). the required rate of return of 3.4% (2019: 7.8%) 
was determined in accordance with danish fsa rules.

collection case, the flexinvest fri case and other investor protection cases.  
 
regulatory and legal proceedings include civil court, arbitration or tribunal proceedings brought against companies within the danske bank group 
(whether by way of claim or counterclaim) or civil disputes that may, if not settled, result in court, arbitration or tribunal proceedings. regulatory matters 
refer to investigations, reviews and other actions carried out by, or in response to the actions of, regulators or law enforcement agencies in connection 
with alleged wrongdoing by companies within the danske bank group. for futher information on regulatory and legal proceedings, including the estonia

g25. equity 
 
equity is the residual interest in the assets after deducting all liabilities recognised in the balance sheet. equity is divided between capital and reserves 
that are attributable to holders of shares issued by the group (owners of danske bank a/s) and other parties holding an interest in the net assets of the 
group.  
 
at the end of 2020, the nominal value of issued additional tier 1 capital in danske bank group amounted to dkk 17,658 million (2019: dkk 24,219 
million) of which dkk 8,579 million (2019: dkk 14,205 million) is accounted for as equity instruments and dkk 9,079 million (2019: 10,014 million) 
as liability instruments, see note g22. danske bank a/s may, at its sole discretion, omit interest and principal payments to bondholders. additional tier 
1 capital that are accounted for as equity instruments are included in equity as a non-controlling interest. this means that equity was increased at the 
time of issue by the net proceeds received. when interest is paid, the amount paid to investors reduces equity at the time of payment and does not affect 
net profit. if the group decides to repay the capital, equity will be reduced by the redemption amount at the time of redemption. the capital issued is 
included in tier 1 capital instruments in the statement of capital as it meets the criteria of the crr for such instruments.  
 
accounting policy  
equity is the residual interest in recognised assets after deduction of recognised liabilities. in this context, the following items are of particular interest: 
 
own shares  
amounts received or paid for the group’s sale or purchase of danske bank shares are recognised directly in equity under transactions with owners. 
the same applies to premiums received or paid for derivatives entailing settlement in own shares. a capital reduction by cancellation of own shares 
will lower the share capital by an amount equal to the nominal value of the shares at the time of registration of the capital reduction. 
 
additional tier 1 capital 
the capital instruments accounted for as equity instruments include no contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to the holders, 
as danske bank a/s may, at its sole discretion, omit payment of interest and principal payments to the bondholders. therefore, the issue does not fall 
under the definition of financial liabilities under ias 32. the net amount received at the time of issue is recognised as an increase in equity. interest 
payments are accounted for as dividends, which are recognised directly in equity at the time the payment obligation arises. if danske bank a/s chooses 
to redeem the bonds, equity will be reduced by the redemption amount at the time of redemption. amounts received or paid for the sale or acquisition 
of own holdings of additional tier 1 capital instruments are recognised directly in equity, similarly to holdings of own shares. 
 
 
 
(a) further explanation 
equity consists of various components, including the accumulated balance of each class of other comprehensive income, retained earnings and issued 
additional tier 1 capital. the various components of equity are described below. tax on items recognised directly in equity is recognised under retained 
earnings. 
 
foreign currency translation reserve 
assets and liabilities of units outside denmark are translated into dkk at the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet date. income and expenses 
are translated at the applicable exchange rates at the transaction date. gains and losses arising at the translation of net investments in units outside 
denmark are recognised under other comprehensive income and recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. net investments 
include the net assets and goodwill of the units as well as holdings in the form of subordinated loan capital and other loans to the units for which settlement 
is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. exchange rate adjustments of financial liabilities used for hedging the group’s net 
investments are also recognised under other comprehensive income and in the foreign currency translation reserve. further information can be found 
in note g12(d). 
 
if the net investment in a unit outside denmark is sold, translation differences, including the impact from hedge, are reclassified from other 
comprehensive income to the income statement. 
 
reserve for bonds at fair value through other comprehensive income  
the reserve covers unrealised fair value adjustments, other than expected credit losses and foreign exchanges gains and losses, of bonds measured at 
fair value through other comprehensive income. unrealised fair value adjustments of hedged interest rate risks that qualify for fair value hedge accounting 
are recognised in the income statement and are not included in the reserve. when bonds are sold, the group reclassifies unrealised value adjustments 
from the reserve to the income statement. 
 
proposed dividends 
the board of directors’ proposal for dividends for the year submitted to the general meeting is included as a separate reserve in equity. the dividends 
are recognised as a liability when the general meeting has adopted the proposal.

g25. equity continued 
 
share-based payments 
share-based payments by the group are settled in danske bank shares. the fair value at the grant date is expensed over the vesting period and set off 
against equity. at the time of exercise, payments by employees are recognised as an increase in equity. as with other purchases of danske bank shares, 
shares acquired for hedging purposes reduce equity by the amount paid. 
 
non-controlling interests 
non-controlling interests’ share of equity equals the carrying amounts of the net assets in group undertakings not owned directly or indirectly by danske 
bank a/s. non-controlling interests amounted to dkk 0 million (2019: dkk 1 million) and are presented under ‘additional tier 1 capital’ as other holders 
of equity than shareholders of the parent company. 
 
additional tier 1 capital holders 
this reserve includes the net proceed received at the time of issuance and accrued interest not yet paid to the holders of the capital. 
 
as described above, danske bank a/s may, at its sole discretion, cancel interest payments to additional tier 1 bond holders (equity accounted as well as 
liability accounted bonds). any interest payments must be paid out of distributable items, which primarily consist of retained earnings at danske bank 
a/s and danske bank group (see section 5.4.3 of risk management 2019 for further information). the additional tier 1 capital will be either written 
down temporarily or converted into a variable number of shares (depending on if the common equity tier 1 ratio falls below 7% for danske bank a/s or 
danske bank group). the ratio at year-end is disclosed in the statement of capital for danske bank a/s and danske bank group. bonds that are 
temporarily written down are accounted for as equity, while bonds that convert into a variable number of ordinary shares are accounted for as liabilities 
(included in note g22).

the amounts shown in the two last columns represent the nominal value translated into danish kroner at the applicable exchange rates at 31 december, 
and equal the amounts included as tier 1 capital in the statement of capital. in the financial statements, the instruments have increased equity by the 
proceeds received at the time of issue and is not subsequently changed due to changes in e.g. exchange rates. at the end of 2020, the fair value of the 
outstanding equity accounted additional tier 1 capital amounted to dkk 8,867 million (2019: dkk 14,639 million).  
 
in april 2020, the group redeemed eur 750 million of additional tier 1 capital at the first call date. the redemption led to a reduction in shareholders’ 
equity of dkk 5,600 million.  
 
a. 
interest is paid semi-annually at an annual rate of 5.875. if certain criteria are fulfilled, including approval by the danish fsa, the bonds may be 
redeemed at par from april 2022. if the bonds are not redeemed, the annual interest rate will be reset at 5.471 percentage points above the 7-year 
eur swap rate every seventh year. the capital is temporarily written down if danske bank group’s or danske bank a/s’ commen equity tier 1 capital 
ratio falls below 7%. the instrument is included as a crr compliant additional tier 1 capital instrument in the statement of capital. 
 
b. 
interest is paid quarterly at a variable rate of 3m cibor + 4.75% p.a. if certain criteria are fulfilled, including approval by the danish fsa, the bonds 
may be redeemed at par from november 2021. if the bonds are not redeemed, the margin remains unchanged. the capital is temporarily written 
down if danske bank group’s or danske bank a/s’ commen equity tier 1 capital ratio falls below 7%. the instrument is included as a crr compliant 
additional tier 1 capital instrument in the statement of capital.

the bank is reporting to, responding to and cooperating with various authorities, including sØik, the u.s. department of justice (doj) and the u.s. securities 
and exchange commission (sec), relating to the bank’s estonian branch. the internal investigation work that the bank had planned to complete during 2020 
has been finalised and the bank has reported the findings to relevant authorities. the bank continues to fully cooperate and will provide the authorities with 
further information if and when requested.  the overall timing of the authorities’ investigations remains unknown and is not within the bank’s control. it is not 
yet possible to reliably estimate the timing, form of resolution, or amount of potential settlement or fines, which could be material. 
 
based on orders from the danish fsa, danske bank’s solvency need has been increased in 2018 by a pillar ii add-on of in total dkk 10 billion to ensure 
adequate capital coverage of the increased compliance and reputational risks in relation to the estonian aml matter. 
 
on 9 january 2019, an action was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york by an alleged holder of danske bank’s 
american depositary receipts, representing its ordinary shares, against the bank and certain of its officers and former officers and/or directors. the 
complaint alleges that the defendants violated section 10(b) and section 20(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934 by, among other things, making 
false and misleading statements and/or failing to disclose adverse information regarding the bank’s business and operations in relation to aml matters 
relating to the bank’s estonian branch and related matters. the complaint seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the 
bank’s american depositary receipts between 9 january 2014 and 29 april 2019. on 24 august 2020, the court granted the motion and dismissed 
all claims against the bank on three independent grounds. on 23 september 2020, the plaintiffs filed an appeal of this ruling to the second circuit. the 
bank intends to oppose that appeal, and a decision is expected in the second half of 2021. the bank intends to defend against these claims. the timing 
of the completion of the lawsuit and the outcome are uncertain. 
 
on 3 march 2019, a court case was initiated against danske bank for approval of a class action lead by a newly formed association with the aim to 
represent former and current shareholders in a liability action relating to the estonian aml matter. on 21 january 2021, the court dismissed the case 
because it did not fulfil the criteria for being approved as a class action. the bank expects that the association will seek to appeal the dismissal. the 
appeal, if any, would not be decided until late 2021 at the earliest. in march 2019 (153), october 2019 (60), january 2020 (9), march 2020 (38) and 
september 2020 (55) in total 315 separate cases were initiated against the bank with a total claim amount of approximately dkk 7.5 billion. on 27 
december 2019 (63) and on 4 september 2020 (30), two separate claims were filed by 93 investors against danske bank with a total claim amount of 
approximately dkk 1.7 billion. on 2 september 2020, 20 separate claims were filed by 20 investors against danske bank with a total claim amount of 
approximately dkk 1.1 billion. on 18 september 2020, one case was filed by 201 investors with a total claim value of approximately dkk 2.1 billion. on 
18 september 2020, one case was filed against the bank (and the bank's former ceo, thomas f. borgen) by two investors with a total claim amount of 
dkk 10 million. these court actions relate to alleged violations in the bank’s branch in estonia of the rules on prevention of money laundering and/or 
alleged failure to timely inform the market of such violations (and in one claim, also market manipulation). 209 of the 315 cases filed in the period from 
march 2019 to september 2020 have been referred to the eastern high court. the remaining 106 cases are currently stayed before the copenhagen 
city court. the bank intends to defend itself against these claims. the timing of completion of any such lawsuits (pending or threatening) and their 
outcome are uncertain. 
 
on 20 february 2020, danske bank received a procedural notification in a case initiated against thomas f. borgen by 74 institutional investors, and 
funded by the litigation funder deminor recovery services. the total claim amount is approximately dkk 2.7 billion. under danish law, the purpose of a 
procedural notification is to make a formal reservation of rights to bring a potential claim against the notified party in the future. 
 
other 
owing to its business volume, danske bank is continually a party to various other lawsuits and disputes and has an ongoing dialogue with public 
authorities, such as the danish fsa on other matters. on 14 november 2019, danske bank was preliminarily charged by sØik for violating the danish 
executive order on investor protection in connection with the flexinvest fri case. danske bank has cooperated fully with sØik and in november 2020 
accepted a fine of dkk 9 million after which the matter has been closed. in general, danske bank does not expect the outcomes of any of these other 
pending lawsuits and disputes or its dialogue with public authorities to have any material effect on its financial position. provisions for litigations are 
included in other liabilities, see note g24.

(d) further explanation 
a limited number of employees are employed under terms which, if they are dismissed before reaching their normal retirement age, grant them a 
severance and/or pension payment in excess of their entitlement under ordinary terms of employment. as the sponsoring employer, the group is also 
liable for the pension obligations of a number of company pension funds.  
 
the group participates in the danish guarantee fund and the danish resolution fund. the funds’ capital must amount to at least 0.8% and 1%, 
respectively, of the covered deposits of all danish credit institutions by 31 december 2024. the danish guarantee fund is currently fully funded, but if 
the fund subsequently does not have sufficient means to make the required payments, extraordinary contributions of up to 0.5% of the individual 
institution’s covered deposits may be required. extraordinary contributions above this percentage require the consent of the danish fsa. the first 
contribution to the danish resolution fund was made in december 2015. danske bank a/s and realkredit danmark a/s make contributions to the 
resolution fund on the basis of their size and risk relative to other credit institutions in denmark. the contribution to the danish resolution fund is 
recognised as operating expenses.  
 
if the resolution fund does not have sufficient means to make the required payments, extraordinary contributions of up to three times the latest annual 
contributions may be required. in addition, danish banks participate in the danish restructuring fund, which reimburses creditors if the final dividend is 
lower than the interim dividend in respect of banks that were in distress before 1 june 2015. similarly, danish banks have made payment commitments 
(totalling dkk 1 billion) to cover losses incurred by the danish restructuring fund for the withdrawal of distressed banks from data centres etc. payments 
to the danish restructuring fund are calculated on the basis of the individual credit institution’s share of covered deposits relative to other credit 
institutions in denmark. however, each institution’s contribution to the danish restructuring fund may not exceed 0.2% of its covered deposits. 
 
the group is a member of deposit guarantee schemes and other compensation schemes in norway, the uk and luxembourg. as in denmark, the 
contributions to the schemes in these countries are annual contributions combined with extraordinary contributions if the means of the schemes are not 
sufficient to cover the required payments. 
 
danske bank a/s is taxed jointly with all danish entities of danske bank group and is jointly and severally liable with these for payment of danish 
corporation tax and withholding tax, etc.  
 
danske bank a/s is registered jointly with all significant danish entities of danske bank group for financial services employer tax and vat, for which

g30. transferred financial assets that are not derecognised  
 
the group enters into transactions that transfer ownership of financial assets, such as bonds and shares, to a counterparty, while the group retains the 
risks associated with the holding of the assets. if the group retains all significant risks, the securities remain in the balance sheet, and the transactions 
are accounted for as loans received against collateral. such transactions are repo transactions and securities lending. the transactions involve selling 
the securities to be repurchased at a fixed price at a later date. counterparties are entitled to sell the securities or deposit them as collateral for loans.

g32. offsetting of financial assets and liabilities   
 
offsetting of financial assets and liabilities in the financial statements requires some criteria to be fulfilled. in the event that the counterparty or the group 
defaults, further offsetting will take place. this note shows the offsetting in the financial statements, further netting according to enforceable master 
netting agreements and similar agreements (i.e. in the event of default) and collateral provided or received under such agreements. 
 
accounting policy 
assets and liabilities are offset when the group and the counterparty have a legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts and have agreed to 
settle the balances on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. positive and negative fair values of derivatives with the 
same counterparty are offset if the group has agreed with the counterparty to settle contractual cash flows net and to make cash payments or provide 
collateral on a daily basis to cover changes in the fair value of the derivative position. master netting agreements or similar agreements give the right 
to additional offsetting in the event of default. such agreements reduce the exposure further in the event of default, but do not qualify for offsetting in 
accordance with ifrs.

(a) financial instruments at fair value 
the fair value is the amount for which a financial asset or a financial liability can be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties. fair value is 
measured on the basis of the following hierarchy:  
 
the fair value hierarchy 
• 
quoted price (level 1) consists of financial instruments that are quoted in an active market. the group uses the price quoted in the principal market. 
• 
valuation based on observable input (level 2) consists of financial instruments valued substantially on the basis of observable input other than a 
quoted price for the instrument itself. if a financial instrument is quoted in a market that is not active, the group bases its measurement on the most 
recent transaction price. adjustment is made for subsequent changes to market conditions, for instance, by including transactions in similar 
financial instruments that are assumed to be motivated by normal business considerations. for a number of financial assets and liabilities, no 
market exists. in such cases, the group uses recent transactions in similar instruments and discounted cash flows or other generally accepted 
estimation and valuation techniques based on market conditions at the balance sheet date to calculate an estimated value. this category covers 
instruments such as derivatives valued on the basis of observable yield curves and exchange rates and illiquid mortgage bonds valued by reference 
to the value of similar liquid bonds. 
• 
valuation based on significant non-observable input (level 3): the valuation of certain financial instruments is based substantially on non-observable 
input. such instruments include unlisted shares, some unlisted bonds and a limited portion of the derivatives portfolio (2%).  
 
if, at the balance sheet date, a financial instrument’s classification differs from its classification at the beginning of the year, the classification of the 
instrument changes. changes are considered to have taken place at the balance sheet date. developments in the financial markets have resulted in 
reclassifications between the categories. some bonds have become illiquid and have therefore been moved from the quoted prices to the observable 
input category, while other bonds have instead become liquid and have been moved from the observable input to the quoted prices category.

g33. fair value information for financial instruments continued 
 
valuation techniques 
the most frequently used valuation techniques include the pricing of transactions with future settlement and swap models that apply present value 
calculations, credit pricing models and options models, such as black & scholes models. as part of the group’s control environment, valuation models are 
validated by units that are independent of the business units that develop the models and trade in the products covered by the models. validation is made 
to test the implementation, quality and operating stability of models to ensure that the models can be used for pricing and risk management of financial 
products. 
 
loans granted and bonds issued by realkredit danmark are recognised at the fair value of the issued bonds (the quoted price in an active market). the 
group adjusts for changes to the fair value of the credit risk on borrowers etc. the adjustment is described further in note g16. 
 
the value of derivatives, primarily long-term contracts, is determined on observable yields extrapolated to yield curves for the full duration of the contracts. 
moreover, the very limited portfolio of credit derivatives is valued on the basis of observable input as well as assumptions about the probability of default 
(recovery rate). unlisted shares are measured at fair value in accordance with the international private equity and venture capital valuation guidelines 
(ipev) which are compliant with ifrs. ipev guides the calculation of the estimated fair value of unlisted shares as the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. valuation methods include 
discounted cash flow models and pricing based on a multiple of earnings or equity. 
 
fair value adjustments 
management estimates underlie the valuation of financial instruments for which the value is based on valuation techniques. the group makes fair value 
adjustments to cover changes in counterparty risk (cva and dva) on derivatives, funding risk (fva and colva), bid-offer spreads on the net open position 
of portfolios with offsetting market risk, and model risk on level 3 derivatives. 
 
credit value adjustment (cva), debit value adjustment (dva) and funding value adjustment (fva and colva)  
the group makes a fair value adjustment to cover the counterparty credit risk on derivatives with a positive fair value (cva). for a given counterparty’s 
portfolio of derivatives, cva is calculated as a function of the probability of default (pd), the expected positive exposure (epe) and the loss given default in 
the event of bankruptcy (lgd). the group enters into derivatives transactions mainly with counterparties in the scandinavian market.  
 
the pds used in the cva model are derived from single name liquid credit default swap (cds). if this is not available, the pds are derived using proxy-
mapping to a cds index. for the calculation of epe, the group uses simulations to estimate the expected positive exposures to the counterparty’s portfolio 
over the term of the derivatives. the exposure model is based fully on market-implied data. for the calculation of lgd, the group uses market compliant 
lgd. however, for customers classified in stage 3 in relation to the expected credit loss impairment, cva is calculated as if the derivatives were loans 
subject to impairment because of credit losses.  
 
a fair value adjustment for derivatives with an expected negative exposure is made to cover the counterparty's credit risk on danske bank (dva), with pd 
calculated according to principles similar to cva. the group uses pd values derived from danske bank’s liquid cds spread.  
 
a fair value adjustment for derivatives to cover expected funding costs (fva and colva) is calculated. fva primarily arises from the cost of funding 
uncollaterialised derivatives. the adjustment is a function of the unsecured funding curve and expected future exposures. colva takes into account the 
funding cost and benefit on collateralised derivatives. the colva adjustment was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2020 and is a function of expected 
collateral balances and cross-currency basis and repo spreads. 
 
at the end of 2020, cva, dva, fva and colva came to a net amount of dkk 1.5 billion (2019: dkk 1.5 billion), including the adjustment for credit risk 
on derivatives in stage 3.  
 
bid-offer spread 
for portfolios of assets and liabilities with offsetting market risk, the group bases its measurement of the portfolios on mid-market prices and makes fair 
value adjustments to recognise net assets at the bid price and net liabilities at the offer price (exit prices). at the end of 2020, these fair value adjustments 
totalled dkk 114 million (2019: dkk 127 million). 
 
model risk 
to account for the uncertainty associated with measuring the value of derivatives on the basis of non-observable input (level 3 in the fair value hierarchy), 
the group has established guidelines to quantify risk. the group calculates and monitors the reserve on an ongoing basis. at the end of 2020, the reserve 
totalled dkk 0 million (2019: dkk 0 million).

amortisation of initial margin 
if, at the time of acquisition, a difference arises between the model value of a financial instrument, calculated on the basis of non-observable input and 
actual cost (day-one profit or loss), and the difference is not the result of transaction costs, the group adjusts model parameters to actual cost to take 
the initial margin into account. accordingly, the valuation of derivatives includes amortisation of the value of initial margins over the remaining term to 
maturity. the initial margins relate to elements not covered by the above cva, dva and fva adjustments, such as future administrative expenses and 
capital consumption. at 31 december 2020, the value of unamortised initial margins was dkk 1,407 million (2019: dkk 1,306 million).

for unlisted shares allocated to insurance contract policyholders, the policyholders assume most of the risk on the shares. therefore, changes in the fair 
value of those shares will only to a limited extent affect the group’s net profit. the group’s remaining portfolio of unlisted shares consists primarily of 
banking-related investments and holdings in private equity funds. the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in the unobservable input 
disclosed in the table is calculated as a 10% increase or 10 % decrease in fair value. under current market conditions, a 10 % decrease in the fair value 
is considered to be below a possible alternative estimate of the fair value at the end of the period. the unrealised adjustments in 2020 were attributable 
to various unlisted shares. 
 
the estimated fair value of illiquid bonds depends significantly on the estimated credit spread. in the table, the sensitivity of the fair value measurement 
to changes in non-observable input is calculated as a 50bps widening or narrowing of the credit spread. 
 
a substantial number of derivatives valued on the basis of non-observable input are hedged by similar derivatives or are used for hedging the credit risk 
on bonds also valued on the basis of non-observable input. changing one or more of the non-observable inputs to reflect reasonable, possible alternative 
assumptions would not change the fair value of the derivatives significantly above what is already covered by the reserve related to fair value adjustment 
for model risk.

the value adjustment through profit or loss is recognised under net trading income or loss. the transfer of derivatives to the observable input category 
consists primarily of maturity reductions, implying that the yield curves have become observable. 
 
(b) financial instruments at amortised cost 
in this section, the fair value of financial instruments recognised at amortised cost is presented. the fair value is based on quoted market prices, if 
available. if quoted prices are not available, the value is approximated to reflect the price that would have been fixed had the terms been agreed at the 
balance sheet date.  
 
the fair values disclosed below are determined on the basis of the following principles: 
 
investment securities (bonds classified as held-to-collect), other issued bonds and subordinated debt 
quoted prices in an active market exist for a significant part of these financial instruments. if quoted prices in an active market do not exist, the group 
uses an estimate of the current return required by the market to estimate the fair value. 
 
other financial instruments 
the determination of the fair value of financial instruments recognised at amortised cost is based on the following preconditions relating to interest rate 
risk: 
 
• 
for a significant number of the group’s deposits and loans, the interest rate depends on the standard variable rate fixed by the group. the rate is 
adjusted only upon certain changes in market conditions. such deposits and loans are considered to carry interest at a variable rate, as the standard 
variable rate fixed by the group at any time applies to both new and existing arrangements. 
• 
the interest rate risk on some fixed-rate loans extended by the group is designated as a hedge of the interest rate risk on liabilities. interest rate 
risk not hedging the interest rate risk on liabilities is hedged by derivatives. such hedges are accounted for as fair value hedges, and the fair value 
of the hedged interest risk is adjusted in the carrying amount of the hedged financial instruments. consequently, only fair value changes related to 
fixed-rate loans not hedged by derivatives are adjusted in the fair values presented in the table below.  
 
for financial instruments that are only to a limited extent influenced by changes in credit risk, the amortised cost, including the adjustment for the fair 
value hedge accounting of the interest rate risk, is a reasonable approximation of fair value. this is the case for due from/to credit institutions and central 
banks and deposits. 
 
it is assessed that the expected credit loss impairment model used for loans measured at amortised cost is a reasonable proxy for the fair value of the 
credit risk.

g34. non-financial assets recognised at fair value 
 
non-financial assets are recognised at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis after initial recognition. investment property is measured at fair value 
on a recurring basis, and assets that are marketed for sale and expected to be sold within one year are written down to fair value less expected costs to sell, 
i.e. measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. 
  
accounting policy 
investment property (fair value on recurring basis) 
investment property is recognised at fair value through profit or loss. property investments are made for own investment purposes and recognised 
under other assets, or on behalf of insurance customers and recognised under assets under insurance contracts and assets under pooled schemes 
and unit-linked investment contracts. value adjustments of investment property are recognised under other income.  
 
the fair value is assessed by the group’s valuers at least once a year on the basis of a discounted cash flow model.  
 
assets held for sale (fair value on non-recurring basis) 
assets held for sale are measured at the lower of cost and fair value less expected costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.

the investment properties included in the table above consist of investments made for own investment purposes. the valuations rely substantially on 
non-observable input. valuations are based on cash flow estimates and on the required rate of return calculated for each property that reflects the price 
at which the property can be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties under current market conditions. the cash flow estimates are determined 
on the basis of the market rent for each property. the required rate of return on a property is determined on the basis of its location, type, possible uses, 
layout and condition as well as on the terms of lease agreements, rent adjustment and the credit quality of lessees. the required rate of return ranged 
between 2.5-8.0% (2019: 2.5-8.5%) and averaged 5.1% (2019: 5.2%). an increase in the required rate of return of 1.0 percentage point would reduce 
fair value at end-2020 by dkk 342 million (2019: dkk 314 million). 
 
investment properties held on behalf of insurance customers amount to dkk 22,694 million (2019: dkk 21,053 million), including dkk 5,767 million 
(2019: dkk 5,175 million) related to unit-linked investment contracts. changes in the fair value of these will only to a limited extent affect the group’s 
net profit. the valuation is based on the same principles as investments made for own investment purposes. the required rate of return ranged between 
2.5-8.0% (2019: 2.5-8.5%) and averaged 4.6% (2019: 4.8%). an increase in the required rate of return of 1.0 percentage point would reduce fair value 
at end-2020 by dkk 4,081 million (2019: dkk 4,211 million). 
 
(b) assets held for sale  
non-financial assets held for sale are measured at the lower of cost and fair value less expected costs to sell and include lease assets (where the group 
act as lessor) put up for sale, and properties taken over by the group under non-performing loan agreements. note g23 provides more information. 
during 2020, a negative fair value adjustment of dkk 78 million was recognised on properties held for sale. no significant changes in the fair value of 
non-financial assets held for sale occured during 2019.

danske bank a/s acts as the bank of a number of its related parties. payment services, trading in securities and other instruments, depositing of surplus 
liquidity and provision of short- and long-term financing are the primary services provided by danske bank a/s.  
 
danica pension manages the pension plans of a number of related parties, and danske bank manages the assets of a number of the group’s pension 
funds. 
 
accounting policy  
a related party to the group is either a party over which the group has control or significant influence or a party that has control or significant influence 
over the group. all entities over which the group has control are consolidated and are therefore not considered a related party to the group.  
 
entities that are related parties to the group comprise shareholders that have a significant holding of shares (significant influence over the group), 
associates, joint venture partners or defined benefit pension plan providers (the group has significant influence over the entity). further, key 
management personnel, defined as members of the board of directors and the executive leadership team, are related parties to the group. 
 
transactions with related parties are settled on an arm’s-length basis and recognised in the financial statements according to the same accounting 
policy as for similar transactions with unrelated parties.

the members of the executive leadership team may choose not to receive pension contributions from the bank and instead to receive a corresponding 
amount as a fixed salary, which is not eligible for bonus. 
 
during the notice period, the executive leadership members are only entitled to full salary and benefits to the extent the executive does not obtain other 
income during the notice period. the disclosed amount of remuneration for the notice period is before set-off against any other income. the members of the 
executive leadership team are not entitled to severance pay.  
 
(c) remuneration of other material risk takers  
danske bank group is required to identify all employees whose professional activities could have a material impact on the risk profile of danske bank in 
accordance with current legislation. other material risk takers do not include members of the board of directors or the executive leadership team.  
 
at the end of 2020, 634 other material risk takers were designated (end of 2019: 696 other material risk takers). during 2020, 648 full-time-equivalents 
were designated as other material risk takers (2019: 711 ftes). the 648 ftes designated as other material risk takers earned remuneration of dkk 1,220 
million (2019: 711 ftes earned remuneration of dkk 1,302 million), with fixed remuneration amounting to dkk 998 million and variable remuneration 
amounting to dkk 222 million (2019: dkk 1,086 million and dkk 216 million, respectively). variable pay for 2020 is estimated and the final figure is 
determined at the end of february 2021. the final variable pay for material risk takes will be published in the quantitative disclosure on material risk takers’ 
remuneration, compliant with the danish fsa and eba requirements. the disclosure will be available at danskebank.com/remuneration in may 2021. 
 
of the above remuneration for 2020, 388 ftes designated as other material risk takers at the parent company, danske bank a/s, earned remuneration of 
dkk 941 million (2019: dkk 971 million to 438 ftes), with fixed remuneration amounting to dkk 754 million and variable remuneration amounting to dkk 
187 million (2019: dkk 781 million and dkk 190 million, respectively). 
 
the group’s pension obligations towards other material risk takers amounted to dkk 539 million to 99 employees at year-end 2020 (2019: dkk 555 million 
and 101 employees). variable payment for other material risk takers is split into cash and equity shares according to eba regulations. further, 40-60% of 
variable payments are deferred for a minimum of three years. all variable payments are subject to back testing and claw-back if granted on the basis of results 
which has subsequently proven to not be sustainable or accurate. 
 
(d) share-based payment  
the total expense recognised as operating expenses in 2020 arising from share-based payments was dkk 108 million (2019: dkk 90 million). all 
share-based payments are equity-settled. the exact number of shares granted for 2020 will be determined at the end of march 2021. 
 
the group has granted rights to conditional shares under the bonus structure for material risk takers and other employees as part of their variable 
remuneration. such employees have a performance agreement based on the performance of the group, the business unit and the individual employee. 
part of the danske bank shares granted to material risk takers are, as required by the eba, deferred (see section (c) above on variable payment). the fair 
value at the grant date is measured at the expected monetary value of the underlying agreement.  
 
the variable remuneration of the executive leadership team is provided as part of a short-term incentive programme and a long-term incentive programme. 
the short-term incentive programme is structured as the programme for other material risk takers, as described above. however, the rights to danske bank 
shares are deferred for five years, followed by a one year retention period before shares are available to trade. the long-term incentive programme is based 
on total shareholder return performance relative to peers over a three-year performance period. in 2020, there were three long-term incentive programmes 
running and the programmes have a vesting period of three years. the current programmes running are the 2018-2020, the 2019-2021 and the 2020-
2022 long-term incentive programmes. after the vesting period, part of the shares will be paid out. the remaining shares are deferred for five years from 
grant date followed by a one year retention period before shares are available to trade. the remuneration is subject to back-testing and claw-back. the fair 
value of the long-term incentive programmes at the grant date was dkk 5.4 million for the 2020-2022 programme and dkk 7.4 million for the 2019-2021 
programme. the fair value of the shares is calculated at the grant date, which includes valuing market conditions. the estimated fair value is based on relevant 
assumptions, which relate to the expected return on equity and volatility relative to peers. the fair value at grant date is expensed over the three-year vesting 
period.

notes – danske bank group 
g38. group holdings and undertakings 
 
this note provides information on subsidiaries. 
 
accounting policy 
the financial statements consolidate danske bank a/s and group undertakings in which the group has control over financial and operating policy 
decisions. control is said to exist if danske bank a/s, directly or indirectly, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from the involvement with the 
entity and has the ability to affect these returns through the power over the entity. power exists if danske bank a/s, directly or indirectly, holds more 
than half of the voting rights in an undertaking or otherwise has power to control management and operating policy decisions. operating policy control 
may be exercised through agreements about the undertaking’s activities. in the rare situations where potential voting rights exist, these are taken into 
account if danske bank has the practical ability to exercise these rights. 
 
when assessing whether to consolidate investment funds, the group reviews all facts and circumstances to determine whether the group, as fund 
manager, is acting as agent or principal. the group is deemed to be a principal, and the group controls and consolidates a fund when it acts as fund 
manager and cannot be removed without cause (i.e. when kick-out rights are weak), has variable returns through significant holdings, and is able to 
influence the returns of the funds by exercising its power. holdings where all returns belong to customers (pooled schemes and unit-linked investment 
contracts) are not considered as exposure to variable returns, whereas holdings where the majority of the returns belong to customers (holdings related 
to insurance contracts) are considered only limited exposure to variable returns. 
 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared by consolidating items of the same nature and eliminating intra-group transactions, balances and 
trading profits and losses. 
 
undertakings acquired are included in the financial statements at the time of acquisition. the net assets of such undertakings (assets, including 
identifiable intangible assets, less liabilities and contingent liabilities) are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition according to the acquisition 
method. 
 
if the cost of acquisition (until 1 january 2010 including direct transaction costs) exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the excess amount 
is recognised as goodwill. goodwill is recognised in the functional currency of the undertaking acquired. the portion of the acquisition that is attributable 
to non-controlling interests does not include goodwill. 
 
divested undertakings are included in the financial statements until the transfer date. changes in the ownership share in a subsidiary that do not result 
in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. this implies that the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are 
adjusted to reflect the changes in the relative interest in the subsidiary, and any difference between the fair value of the consideration paid/received and 
the adjustment made to non-controlling interests is attributed to the shareholders of danske bank a/s. if changes in the ownership share in a subsidiary 
result in the loss of control, any investment retained in the former subsidiary is recognised at fair value, and amounts recognised under other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement or transferred directly to retained earnings if so required by other ifrss. the difference 
between the fair value of the consideration received plus any investment retained in the former subisidiary and the carrying amount of the net assets in 
the subsidiary less the carrying amounts of any non-controlling interests is recognised in the income statement. 
 
held-for-sale group undertakings 
companies taken over by the group under non-performing loan agreements and actively marketed for sale and expected to be sold within 12 months of 
classification are recognised as held-for-sale. assets and liabilities in such companies are presented under other assets and other liabilities. the assets 
are recognised at the lower of cost and fair value less expected costs to sell. 
 
 
(a) further explanation 
all credit institutions and insurance companies supervised by national fsas are subject to local statutory capital requirements. these requirements 
restrict intra-group facilities and dividend payouts. 
 
danica pension has an obligation to allocate part of the margin by which danica pension’s equity exceeds the statutory solvency requirement to certain 
policyholders who were previously policyholders of statsanstalten for livsforsikring (now part of danica pension). this applies only if the margin exceeds 
the margin in statsanstalten for livsforsikring before the privatisation in 1990 and relates to any excess included in the shareholders’ equity or paid out 
as dividend. such special allotments are expensed and recognised under net insurance benefits.  
 
restrictions impacting the group’s ability to use assets are disclosed in note g31 and include, among others, assets pledged as collateral under repo 
transactions funded by covered bonds and assets held by insurance subsidiaries that are primarily held to satisfy obligations to policyholders’ savings.  
 
the group has established a number of investment funds in which the group acts as fund manager. the group has consolidated investment funds of dkk 
9,656 million (2019: dkk 11,088 million), as the group is deemed to be acting as principal rather than agent in its role as fund manager and as the 
group is the sole investor. the investments are held to satisfy obligations towards insurance policyholders and are recognised under assets under 
insurance contracts. the group does not have consolidated structured entities in the form of securitisation vehicles or asset-backed financing vehicles. 
 
(b) acquisition of subsidiary undertakings  
the group did not make any acquisitions of undertakings in 2020 and 2019. in 2019, the group recognised impairment charges of dkk 800 million on 
the goodwill related to the acquisition in 2018. further information can be found in note g19.

notes – danske bank group 
g39. interests in associates and joint arrangements 
 
this note provides information about the group’s interests in associates and joint arrangements. 
 
accounting policy 
joint ventures and associates are entities other than group undertakings in which the group has holdings and joint control with one or more parties or 
significant but not controlling influence, respectively. the group generally classifies entities as joint ventures/associates if danske bank a/s, directly or 
indirectly, holds 20-50% of the share capital and has influence over management and operating policy decisions. holdings in joint ventures and associates 
are recognised at cost at the date of acquisition and are subsequently measured according to the equity method. the proportionate share of the net profit or 
loss of the individual entity is included under income from holdings in associates. the share is calculated on the basis of data from financial statements with 
balance sheet dates no earlier than three months before the group’s balance sheet date. if objective evidence of impairment exists, the investment is 
recognised at the lower of carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows.  
 
the proportionate share of the profit or loss on transactions between associates/joint ventures and group undertakings is eliminated. 
 
ownership shares held by the group’s insurance business are treated as held by a venture capital organisation and are measured at fair value.

group totalled dkk 737.3 billion (2019: dkk 721.9 billion). the group retained holdings of dkk 122.7 billion (2019: dkk 114.6 billion) in these funds. 
substantially all of these holdings are related to pooled schemes, unit-linked investment contracts and insurance contracts. income generated to the 
group in the form of management fees amounted to dkk 3.4 billion (2019: dkk 3.5 billion). in addition, the group has holdings in private equity 
investment funds of dkk 0.1 billion (2019: dkk 0.1 billion). 
 
the group has limited exposure to structured securitisation entities. the exposure dates back to the period between 2001-2007 when the group acted 
as an investor. this involved the purchase of bonds and entering into facilities for securitisation assets that were either structurally senior or triple a-
rated by at least one of the major rating agencies. the group has not acted as a sponsor or an orginator, and none of the assets of the structured entities 
were previously held on the group's balance sheet. the remaining exposure consists mainly of liquidity facilities and is reported as part of the credit 
exposure in the non-core segment. at end-2020, the gross exposure amounted to dkk 3.4 billion (2019: dkk 4.4 billion). during the year, the group 
did not provide any non-contractual financial or other support to any of the structural entities. the key risk on the portfolio relates to the underlying 
securitisation transactions, which consist mainly of commercial and residential mortgage loans originated in the uk and germany.

notes – danske bank group – risk management 
risk exposure 
 
danske bank group is exposed to a number of risks and manages them at various organisational levels.  
 
the main categories of financial risks are the following: 
• 
credit risk: the risk of losses because debtors or counterparties fail to meet all or part of their payment obligations to the group. 
• 
market risk: the risk of losses because the fair value of the group’s assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items varies with changes in market 
conditions. 
• 
liquidity risk: the risk of losses because funding costs become excessive, lack of funding prevents the group from maintaining its business model, 
or lack of funding prevents the group from fulfilling its payment obligations. 
• 
insurance risk: all types of risk at danica pension, including market risk, life insurance risk and operational risk. 
• 
non-financial risk. the risk of financial losses or gains, regulatory impact, reputational impact or customer impact resulting from inadequate or 
failed internal processes, people ord systems or from external events, including legal and compliance risks. 
 
danica pension is a wholly-owned subsidiary of danske bank a/s. as required by danish law and the danish executive order on the contribution principle, 
danica pension has notified the danish financial supervisory authority (the danish fsa) of its profit policy. the contribution principle and the profit policy 
mean that policyholders assume risks and receive the returns on assets allocated to them. assets are allocated to policyholders to secure their 
guaranteed benefits. market risk and other risks on assets and liabilities allocated to policyholders are therefore not consolidated in the tables of this 
section, but are treated in the section on insurance risk. 
 
the management’s report and risk management 2020 provide a detailed description of danske bank group’s risk management practices, including on 
pension and non-financial risk. risk management 2020 is available at danskebank.com/ir. the publication is not covered by the statutory audit. 
 
total capital  
capital risk is the risk of not having enough capital to cover all material risks arising from the group’s chosen business strategy. 
 
danske bank group has licences to provide financial services and must therefore comply with the capital requirements of the capital requirements 
regulation (crr) and the danish financial business act. the danish rules are based on the eu capital requirements directive (crd iv) and apply to both 
danske bank a/s (the parent company) and the group. similarly, the group’s financial subsidiaries in and outside denmark must comply with local capital 
requirements. the regulatory requirements stipulate a minimum capital level of 8% of the total risk exposure amount (rea) under pillar i (including risk 
exposure amounts for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, market risk and operational risk). in addition, financial institutions are required to calculate 
their solvency need under pillar ii to reflect all relevant risks. danske bank a/s was designated a systemically important financial institution (sifi) in 
denmark in 2014. this means that the group is subject to stricter requirements than non-sifis. danske bank group’s sifi buffer requirement is set at 
an additional 3% above the regulatory requirements for common equity tier 1 (cet1) capital.  
 
the group’s total capital consists of tier 1 capital (share capital and additional tier 1 capital after deductions) and tier 2 capital (subordinated loan capital 
after deductions).  
 
the group’s cet1 capital is based on the carrying amount of shareholders’ equity corrected for equity-accounted additional tier 1 capital and adjusted 
with the following main deductions. 
• 
adjustments to eligible capital instruments 
• 
prudential filters 
• 
proposed dividends 
• 
intangible assets of banking operations, including goodwill 
• 
deferred tax assets that rely on future profitability 
• 
defined benefit pension fund assets 
• 
statutory deductions for insurance subsidiaries etc. 
• 
reversal of the effect of ifrs 9 (expected credit losses) implementation due to transitional rules 
 
the presentation of the group’s total capital in the statement of capital shows the difference between the carrying amount of shareholders’ equity and 
cet1 capital. at the end of 2020, the group’s cet1 capital amounted to dkk 143.7 billion (2019: dkk 132.7 billion), and its cet1 capital ratio was 
18.3% (2019: 17.3%) 
 
the group’s additional tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital may, subject to certain conditions, be included in total capital. the conditions are described in the 
crr. until the crr is fully phased in, transitional rules apply to instruments that do not qualify for inclusion according to the crr. notes g23 and g25(b) 
show additional tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital. at the end of 2020, the group’s total capital was dkk 180.1 billion (2019: dkk 174.2 billion), and its 
total capital ratio was 23.0% (2019: 22.7%). the group’s tier 1 capital was dkk 161.2 billion (2019: dkk 156.6 billion), and its tier 1 capital ratio was 
20.5% (2019: 20.4%).  
 
risk management 2020 provides a description of the group’s solvency need.

total capital continued 
 
in 2020, the group’s capital targets were unchanged from the increased levels set by the board of directors in 2019. the target for the cet1 capital 
ratio was kept at above 16% in the short term to ensure a sufficiently prudent buffer in relation to the capital requirement. this implies a management 
buffer of at least 2.8% in relation to the fully phased-in cet1 capital requirement. the target for the total capital ratio was kept at above 20%. 
 
the group aspires to improve its credit ratings, which are important for its access to liquidity and for the pricing of its long-term funding. the group 
therefore includes rating targets in its capital considerations. 
 
 
credit risk 
the group offers loans, credits, guarantees and other products as part of its business model and thus takes on credit risk. 
 
credit risk is the risk of losses because debtors or counterparties fail to meet all or part of their payment obligations to the group.  
 
in accordance with th group’s credit policy, the group carefully assesses the financial situation of customers to ensure that loans granted are suited to their 
needs and financial capacity and that customers understand their financial obligations. besides providing loans in a responsible manner, the group has spent 
the past few years integrating sustainability and esg considerations into its lending practices.  
 
in 2015, work began to integrate esg considerations into credit processes with the aim of identifying and managing business with customers believed to 
disregard or deliberately violate un-based principles on environmental protection, human rights, labour rights and anti-corruption. in 2016, the group 
published position statements on sectors with elevated esg risks, describing processes and restrictions within these sectors.  
 
sectors that are recognised to have elevated esg risks are also specified in the credit policy and are subject to periodic review. these include sectors such 
as metals and mining, forestry, fossil fuels, and arms and defence, for which instructions specify minimum requirements for managing esg risks and how to 
perform esg assessments at the customer level. furthermore, esg risk identification is made at the portfolio level for specific sectors on an ongoing basis 
by screening large customers using external esg data providers. in 2019, esg risk identification was discussed as part of the annual sector risk reviews by 
the group all risk committee and the board of directors’ risk committee.  
 
in addition, the group has started to assess and quantify the financial impact of climate-related risks in the lending portfolio in accordance with the 
recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures (tcfd). this means reviewing selected sectors using climate scenarios to 
measure the sensitivity of the portfolio to climate-related risks with the aim of covering key sectors over time. in 2019, this work included an assessment of 
transition risks in the oil and gas portfolio and a physical risk assessment of flooding risk in relation to segments of the real estate portfolio.  
 
overall, the work on both esg integration in general and assessment in accordance with tcfd recommendations is well-aligned with the group’s commitment 
to the principles for responsible banking developed by the united nations environment programme finance initiative. for more information about these 
activities, see the group’s sustainability report 2019. 
 
in order to mitigate credit risk, the group uses collateral, guarantees and covenants. 
 
further information on the group’s risk management practices related to credit risk can be found in the report risk management 2019. 
 
credit exposure 
credit exposure consists of balance sheet items and off-balance-sheet items that carry credit risk. most of the exposure derives from lending activities 
in the form of secured and unsecured loans. the non-core business unit is not considered part of danske bank’s core activities and is stated separately. 
securities positions taken by the group’s trading and investment units also entail credit risk and are presented as credit exposure from trading and 
investment securities as well as derivatives and loans at the group’s trading units.  
 
the overall management of credit risk thus covers credit risk from direct lending activities, counterparty credit risk on derivatives and loans at the 
group’s trading units and credit risk from securities positions.  
 
the group’s exposure to the risk on some balance sheet items is limited. this is the case for assets under customer-funded investment pools, unit-linked 
investment contracts and insurance contracts. the risk on assets under pooled schemes and unit-linked investment contracts is assumed solely by the 
customers, while the risk on assets under insurance contracts is assumed primarily by the customers. the section on insurance risk describes the 
group’s credit risk on insurance contracts.

*other unutilised commitments have been restated to include investment commitments in danica pension of dkk 25.5 billion. 
in addition to credit exposure from lending activities, the group had made uncommitted loan offers and granted uncommitted lines of credit of dkk 242 
billion at 31 december 2020 (2019: dkk 213 billion).these items are included in the calculation of the total risk exposure amount in accordance with 
the capital requirements directive. 
 
credit exposure from core lending activities  
credit exposure from lending activities in the group’s core banking business includes loans, amounts due from credit institutions and central banks, 
guarantees and irrevocable loan commitments. the exposure is measured net of expected credit losses and includes repo loans at amortised cost. for 
reporting purposes, all collateral values are net of haircuts and capped at the exposure amount. the credit exposure from non-core lending activities is 
disclosed further on in these notes.

classification of customers  
the main objectives of risk classification are to rank the group’s customers according to risk and to estimate each customer’s probability of default (pd). as 
part of the credit process, the group classifies customers according to risk and updates their classifications upon receipt of new information. risk 
classification comprises rating and credit scoring of customers. while all large customers are rated, the group uses fully automated and statistically-based 
scoring models for small customers such as personal customers and small businesses. credit scores are updated monthly in a process subject to automated 
controls. 
 
the group has developed a number of classification models to assess customer pd and to classify customers in various segments.  
 
in its credit risk management, the group uses point in time (pit) pd estimates for risk classification. these pit pd estimates express a customer’s 
probability of default within the next 12 months in the current economic situation. the group’s classification scale consists of 11 main rating categories 
with fixed pd bands. during a downturn, a customer’s pit pd may increase, and the customer may migrate to a lower rating category. the effect from a 
downturn is thus larger when pit pd is used than if the classification were based on through-the-cycle (ttc) pd, which the group uses to calculate the 
risk exposure amount for credit risk. 
 
the classification of facilities between stage 1 and 2 for the purpose of calculating expected credit losses under ifrs 9 depends on whether the credit 
risk has increased significantly since initial recognition. the assessment of whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition is 
performed by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the individual facility and incorporating forward-looking 
information. a facility is transferred from stage 1 to stage 2 on the basis of observed increases in the probability of default: 
 
• 
for facilities originated below 1% in pd: an increase in the facility’s 12-month pd of at least 0.5 of a percentage point since initial recognition and a 
doubling in the facility’s lifetime pd since origination. 
• 
for facilities originated above 1% in pd: an increase in the facility’s 12-month pd of 2 percentage points since origination or a doubling of the 
facility’s lifetime pd since origination. 
 
in addition, facilities that are more than 30 days past due are moved to stage 2. 30 days past due is considered a backstop. finally, customers subject to 
forbearance measures are placed in stage 2, if the group, in the most likely outcome, expects no loss or the customers are in the two-year probation 
period for performing forborne exposures.  
 
a facility is transferred from stage 2 to stage 3 when it becomes credit-impaired. a facility becomes credit-impaired when one or more events that have 
a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows have occurred. this includes observable data about (a) significant financial difficulty of the issuer 
or the borrower; (b) a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event; (c) the borrower, for financial or contractual reasons relating to the 
borrower’s financial difficulty, having been granted a concession that would not otherwise have been considered; (d) it is becoming probable that the 
borrower will enter into bankruptcy or other financial restructuring; and (e) the purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects 
the incurred credit loss. it may not be possible to identify a single discrete event – instead, the combined effect of several events may cause a financial 
asset to become credit-impaired. credit-impaired facilities are placed in rating category 10 or 11. for customers in rating category 10, the stage 3 
classification applies only to customers where a loss is expected in the most likely scenario. for rating category 11 (default), all facilities are classified 
as stage 3 exposures. 
 
exposures which are considered to be in default for regulatory purposes will always be categorised as stage 3 exposures under ifrs 9. this applies to 
90-days-past-due considerations and unlikely-to-pay factors leading to regulatory default. 
 
management applies judgement and recognises post-model adjustments to cover risks that are not reflected sufficiently in the group’s expected credit 
loss model. besides increasing the expected credit losses, the post-model adjustments may lead to the transfer of part of the gross exposure covered by 
the post-model adjustments from stage 1 to stage 2 through targeted pd pushes to the current point in time estimates of pd (i.e. increases in the pd for 
the underlying customers in the selected portfolios covered by the post-model adjustments) to ensure consistency between the methods used for 
disclosing information about expected credit losses and exposures subject to significant increase in credit risk. while the distribution of customers 
between the group’s 11 rating categories is unchanged and reflects the current point-in-time estimate of the underlying customers’ pds, the pd pushes 
may lead to the transfer of gross exposures to stage 2 as the assessment of the increase in credit risk is performed by comparing the initial pd with the 
current pd (after the adjustment for the targeted pd pushes).  
 
expected credit losses  
the expected credit loss is calculated for all individual facilities as a function of the probability of default (pd), the exposure at default (ead) and the loss 
given default (lgd). for exposures in stage 1, 12- month expected credit losses are recognised, while lifetime expected credit losses are recognised for 
exposures in stage 2-3. for further information see note g15.

asset to become credit-impaired. credit-impaired facilities are placed in rating category 10 or 11. for customers in rating category 10, the stage 3 
classification applies only to customers where a loss is expected in the most likely scenario. for rating category 11 (default), all facilities are classified 
as stage 3 exposures. 
 
exposures which are considered to be in default for regulatory purposes will always be categorised as stage 3 exposures under ifrs 9. this applies to 
90-days-past-due considerations and unlikely-to-pay factors leading to regulatory default. 
 
management applies judgement and recognises post-model adjustments to cover risks that are not reflected sufficiently in the group’s expected credit 
loss model. besides increasing the expected credit losses, the post-model adjustments may lead to the transfer of part of the gross exposure covered by 
the post-model adjustments from stage 1 to stage 2 through targeted pd pushes to the current point in time estimates of pd (i.e. increases in the pd for 
the underlying customers in the selected portfolios covered by the post-model adjustments) to ensure consistency between the methods used for 
disclosing information about expected credit losses and exposures subject to significant increase in credit risk. while the distribution of customers 
between the group’s 11 rating categories is unchanged and reflects the current point-in-time estimate of the underlying customers’ pds, the pd pushes 
may lead to the transfer of gross exposures to stage 2 as the assessment of the increase in credit risk is performed by comparing the initial pd with the 
current pd (after the adjustment for the targeted pd pushes).  
 
expected credit losses  
the expected credit loss is calculated for all individual facilities as a function of the probability of default (pd), the exposure at default (ead) and the loss 
given default (lgd). for exposures in stage 1, 12- month expected credit losses are recognised, while lifetime expected credit losses are recognised for 
exposures in stage 2-3. for further information see note g15.

the breakdown of the credit portfolio by rating category in 2019 has been restated, leading to a reclassification of gross and net exposures of dkk 9.4 
billion in rating categories 10 and 11 to other rating categories. the restatement is only a matter of presentation and has no impact on the expected 
credit losses, allocation between stages 1-3 or non-performing loans. 
 
for further information about the decrease of dkk 12.8 billion in the gross exposure within stage 2 from 2019 to 2020, see the description below the 
table “credit portfolio in core activities broken down by industry (nace)”.  
 
the gross exposure within stage 3 increased by dkk 6.1 billion from 2019 to 2020 and at the same time the expected credit losses within stage 3 
declined by dkk 0.5 billion. this was primarily due to an increase in collateral (net of haircut) of dkk 7.3 billion.

the table below breaks down credit exposure by industry. the industry segmentation is based on the classification principles of the statistical 
classification of economic activities in the european community (nace) standard adapted to the group’s business risk approach used for the active 
management of the credit portfolio.  
 
expected credit losses increased across the portfolio due to the changes to the macroeconomic outlook following the outbreak of the corona pandemic. 
further, expected credit losses reflected a deterioration of the creditworthiness of specific customers mainly within the oil and gas segment (the shipping, 
oil and gas industry).

as at 31 december 2020, oil and gas exposures represented a gross exposure of dkk 23.3 billion (2019: dkk 29.9 billion) and expected credit losses 
of dkk 2.4 billion (2019: dkk 2.7 billion). those exposures represented the majority of the exposures in stage 3 within the shipping, oil and gas industry 
at the end of 2020. 
 
as described in the section ‘classification of customers’, the post-model adjustments may, besides increasing the expected credit losses, lead to the 
transfer of part of gross exposures covered by the post-model adjustments from stage 1 to stage 2 for some industries. compared to the end of 2019, 
such transfers improved the overall average credit quality of the exposures within stage 2 for some industries. this is the case for the retailing industry. 
 
the gross exposure in stage 2 decreased by dkk 12.8 billion from 2019 to 2020, with especially the agriculture, commercial properties and shipping, 
oil and gas industries showing significant decreases. for agriculture, the decrease in the gross exposure within stage 2 reflected a general improvement 
within the industry, however, combined with part of the exposure being transferred from stage 2 to stage 3 following credit deterioration. for commercial 
property, the development related mainly to the actual development of house prices during 2020, which despite - the corona crisis - turned out to be 
positive. although post-model adjustments were added to commercial property during 2020 with an impact on the expected credit loss, the underlying 
improvement within the stage 1 exposure during 2020 led to a decrease in the gross exposure that was transferred from stage 1 to stage 2 through the 
targeted pd-pushes related to the post-model adjustments for the industry. for shipping, oil and gas, the decrease related to a general decrease in the 
exposure to the industry across all three stages, amongst others due to restructurings leading to write-offs impacting both the stage 2 and 3 exposure.

as at 31 december 2020, oil and gas exposures represented a gross exposure of dkk 23.3 billion (2019: dkk 29.9 billion) and expected credit losses 
of dkk 2.4 billion (2019: dkk 2.7 billion). those exposures represented the majority of the exposures in stage 3 within the shipping, oil and gas industry 
at the end of 2020. 
 
as described in the section ‘classification of customers’, the post-model adjustments may, besides increasing the expected credit losses, lead to the 
transfer of part of gross exposures covered by the post-model adjustments from stage 1 to stage 2 for some industries. compared to the end of 2019, 
such transfers improved the overall average credit quality of the exposures within stage 2 for some industries. this is the case for the retailing industry. 
 
the gross exposure in stage 2 decreased by dkk 12.8 billion from 2019 to 2020, with especially the agriculture, commercial properties and shipping, 
oil and gas industries showing significant decreases. for agriculture, the decrease in the gross exposure within stage 2 reflected a general improvement 
within the industry, however, combined with part of the exposure being transferred from stage 2 to stage 3 following credit deterioration. for commercial 
property, the development related mainly to the actual development of house prices during 2020, which despite - the corona crisis - turned out to be 
positive. although post-model adjustments were added to commercial property during 2020 with an impact on the expected credit loss, the underlying 
improvement within the stage 1 exposure during 2020 led to a decrease in the gross exposure that was transferred from stage 1 to stage 2 through the 
targeted pd-pushes related to the post-model adjustments for the industry. for shipping, oil and gas, the decrease related to a general decrease in the 
exposure to the industry across all three stages, amongst others due to restructurings leading to write-offs impacting both the stage 2 and 3 exposure.

notes – danske bank group – risk management 
 
concentration risk 
 
the group has implemented a set of frameworks to manage the concentration risk to which the group is exposed. these frameworks cover single-name 
concentrations, industry concentrations and geographical concentrations. 
 
industry concentrations 
the group manages industry concentrations as part of its credit risk appetite framework by setting exposure limits on selected industries. the industry 
concentrations are updated on an ongoing basis and at least once a year. the group accepts the risks on material concentrations in accordance with the 
industry-specific guidelines that outline the use of credit policies within the industry. in addition, the group manages key concentrations to personal 
customers in relation to high ltv ratios and short-term interest loans, for example.  
 
geographical concentrations 
credit reporting includes a breakdown by region. limits are set on exposures outside the group’s home markets (sovereigns, financial institutions and 
counterparties in derivatives trading). limits are approved by the group credit committee on the basis of expected business volume and an assessment 
of the specific country risk. 
 
single-name concentrations 
single-name concentrations are managed according to two frameworks: 
• 
single-name concentration instructions: this risk-sensitive internal framework specifies limits on exposure, expected loss (el) and loss given default 
(lgd) in order to limit potential losses on single-name exposures. single-name concentrations are monitored monthly and reported on quarterly basis 
to the group all risk committee, the board risk committee and board of directors. 
 
• 
large exposures instructions: this framework is based on the regulatory definition of large exposures as specified in article 395 of the crr (regulation 
(eu) no. 575/2013). 
 
the group has also defined stricter internal limits for managing single-name concentrations within the large exposure framework, including the following: 
 
• 
absolute limit on single-name exposures 
• 
the sum of single-name exposures larger than 10% of the total adjusted capital may not exceed a portfolio limit of 95% of the total adjusted capital 
• 
the sum of single-name exposures equal to 5% to 10% of the total adjusted capital may not exceed 150% of the total adjusted capital 
 
the largest single-name exposures are monitored daily under the large exposures framework. large exposures are reported on a quarterly basis to the group 
all risk committee, the board risk committee and the board of directors. at the end of 2019, the group was well within the regulatory limits for large 
exposures. 
collateral  
the group uses a number of measures to mitigate credit risk, including collateral, guarantees and covenants. the main method is obtaining collateral. 
 
the market value of collateral is monitored and reassessed by advisers, internal or external assessors, or automatic valuation models. automatic 
valuation models are validated annually and monitored quarterly. the group regularly evaluates the validity of external inputs on which the valuation 
models are based. the collateral system supports the process of reassessing the market value to ensure that the group complies with regulatory 
requirements. 
 
the market value of collateral is subject to a haircut. the haircut reflects the risk that the group will not be able to obtain the estimated market value 
upon the sale of the individual asset in a distressed situation. the haircut applied depends on the type of collateral. for regulatory purposes, the group 
also applies more conservative haircuts to capture the risk of an economic downturn. 
 
the composition of the group’s collateral base reflects the product composition of the credit portfolio. the most important collateral types, measured by 
volume, are real property and vessels and aircrafts. for reporting purposes, all collateral values are net of haircuts and capped by the exposure amount 
at the facility level. 
 
during 2020, the group granted loans with an outstanding amount of dkk 5.0 billion subjet to guarantee schemes offered by the governments in the 
group’s markets to mitigate the economic consequences of the corona crises. the guarantees covered dkk 4.2 billion of the loans. a large part of the 
guarantee schemes related to northern ireland.

for the past due amounts, the average unsecured portion of the claims recorded was 0% at the end of 2020 (2019: 11.7%). real property accounted for 
74.8% of collateral provided (2019: 80.3%). 
 
forbearance practices and repossessed assets  
the group adopts forbearance plans to assist customers in financial difficulty. concessions granted to customers include interest-reduction schedules, 
interest-only schedules, temporary payment holidays, term extensions, cancellation of outstanding fees, waiver of covenant enforcement and debt 
forgiveness. forbearance plans must comply with the group’s credit policy. they are used as an instrument to retain long-term business relationships 
during economic downturns if there is a realistic possibility that the customer will be able to meet its obligations again, or are used for minimising losses 
in the event of default. 
 
if it proves impossible to improve the customer’s financial situation by forbearance measures, the group will consider whether to subject the customer’s 
assets to a forced sale or whether the assets could be realised later at higher net proceeds. at the end of 2020, the group had recognised properties 
taken over in denmark at a carrying amount of dkk 39 million (2019: dkk 15 million), and there were no properties taken over in other countries (2019: 
dkk 0 million). the properties are held for sale and included under other assets in the balance sheet.  
 
forbearance measures lead to changes in staging for impairment purposes, and impairments relating to forborne exposures are handled according to 
the principles described in note g15. 
 
in 2020, the group increased the use of concessions to assist customers affected by the corona crisis. these concessions represented an increase in 
gross exposure of around dkk 44 billion, of which around dkk 6 billion (net of expected credit losses) was considered forbearance measures, see note 
g1(b) for the definition of when such concessions are considered to be a forbearance measure. the concessions related primarily to personal customers 
and to the following industries: shipping, oil and gas, commercial property, transportation and consumer goods. in the group’s nordic markets, such 
concessions were granted on a voluntary basis, while in northern ireland, danske bank was selected by the uk government to provide concessions 
through the uk government-backed lending schemes. 
 
the group has now implemented the european banking authority’s (the eba’s) definition of loans subject to forbearance measures. the table below is 
based on the eba’s definition, which states that a probation period of a minimum of two years must pass from the date when forborne exposures are 
considered to be performing again. such exposures are included in the under probation category in the table below. exposures with forbearance 
measures are divided into performing and non-performing loans. the group’s definition of non-performing loans is described in the next section. the 
increase in forborne exposures relates to proactive forbearance measures taken by the group to improve the financial position of weak customers 
following the corona crisis.

non-performing loans  
 
the group defines non-performing loans as stage 3 exposures. however, for non-retail exposures with one or more non-performing loans, the entire 
amount of the customer’s exposure is considered to be non-performing. for retail exposures, only impaired facilities are included in non-performing loans. 
the group excludes exposures in stage 3 with no impairment charges or where the allowance account is considered immaterial to the gross exposure. 
 
the impact of the corona crisis on total gross npl exposures was limited. at the same time, net npl decreased driven by a decrease in net npl in default.  
 
the table below shows the reconciliation between the gross exposure in stage 3 and gross non-performing loans.

expected credit losses (allowance account) in core activities 
 
the expected credit loss is calculated for all individual facilities as a function of the probability of default (pd), the exposure at default (ead) and the loss 
given default (lgd). in general, the group’s ifrs 9 impairment models and parameters draw on the bank’s internal models in order to ensure alignment 
of models across the group. new models and calculations have been developed especially for ifrs 9 purposes, including models for lifetime pd, 
prepayment and forward-looking lgd. all expected credit loss impairments are allocated to individual exposures. for significant stage 3 exposures, the 
group determines the expected credit losses individually.

in 2020, the group increased the use of modification of the contractual terms in the form of concessions to assist customers affected by the corona 
crisis. a large part of the concessions were short-term reliefs in the form of amortisation holidays. such modifications led only to insignificant modification 
losses (changes in the net present value of the contractual cash flows). in the table above, ‘changes due to modifications that did not result in 
derecognition’ includes partial forgiveness of debt assessed to be uncollectible. the modification loss is recognised within the income statement as part 
of loan impairment charges. the contractual amount of loans written off in 2020 and for which the group retains the right to enforce its claims amounted 
to dkk 3,616 million (2019: dkk 1,480 million).

the forward-looking information is based on a three-year forecast period converging to a steady state level in year seven. the base case is based on the 
macroeconomic outlook as disclosed in the group’s nordic outlook reports. the base-case is an extension of the group’s official view of the nordic 
economies (the nordic outlook report). at 31 december 2020, the base-case scenario used in the modelled expected credit losses was based on the 
nordic outlook report published in october 2020, reflecting a recession in 2020 followed by a recovery in 2021. a comparison between the 
macroeconomic inputs for 2021 and 2022 in the base case sceanario used at the end of 2020 and the inputs used in the base case scenario at the end 
of 2019 shows that they appear to be more positive. however, this should be seen in the light of the inputs developing from a lower starting point (i.e. 
2020) than expected in 2019. when adjustments are made for this, the base case used at the end of 2020 was more negative than the base case 
scenario used at the end of 2019.  
 
the downside scenario reflects a w-shaped trend, where the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic causes new lockdowns in the fourth quarter of 
2020 and the first quarter of 2021. the housing market proved quite resilient to this kind of shock during the first wave of the pandemic. even so, property 
prices are expected to decline in 2021 in the downside scenario as more people will fear for their future income and because the initial shift in consumer 
preferences due to restrictions (boosting demand in the spring) has to some extent already happened. as societies return to normal and the output gap 
starts closing, property prices also start to increase. the recovery is sluggish though, reflecting increased risk aversion among households and 
businesses. fiscal support is more limited and less effective than in the first wave. that said, this scenario assumes that the economy will not suffer 
extensive long-term damage from the crisis and as such will be back on track in the second or third quarter of 2021. the output gap will have grown 
significantly though, reflecting a further decline in gdp in 2021. the nordics are less affected in this scenario compared to most of the rest of the world, 
where the coronavirus is generally more widespread, as is the case in the uk, for instance.  
 
in the current situation, significant uncertainty related to the macroeconomic outlook and the impact on expected credit losses does exist. the scenarios 
used at the end of 2020 were in line with the scenarios published by e.g. the danish central bank. compared with the macroeconomic scenarios used at 
the end september 2020, the updated scenarios lead to a reversal of modelled expected credit losses which was partly offset by recognising further 
post-model adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2020. for further information, see the separate section below.  
 
forecasts are produced for the coming three years. after this period, the outlook returns to a steady state level after a further four years. the 
macroeconomic parameters in the base case and downside scenario used in the ecl calculation for the first three years of the forecast horizon as an 
average across the group’s core markets are included below. the table also includes the macroeconomic parameters for 2020 for a comprehensive 
overview of the scenarios used in relation to the scenarios used at the end of 2019.

at 31 december 2019, the upside scenario represented a slightly better outlook than the base case scenario across the macroeconomic parameters, 
mainly to capture uncertainty to the upside. 
  
the base-case scenario enters with a probability of 60% (2019: 60%), the upside scenario with a probability of 15% (2019: 10%) and the downside 
scenario with a probability of 25% (2019: 30%). on the basis of these assessments, the allowance account at 31 december 2020 amounted to dkk 
22.6 billion (2019: 20.5 billion). if the base case scenario was assigned a probability of 100%, the allowance account would decrease dkk 0.4 billion 
(2019: 0.7 billion). compared to the base case scenario, the allowance account would increase dkk 1.7 billion (2019: 2.4 billion), if the downside scenario 
was assigned a probability of 100%. the increase reflects primarily the transfer of exposures from stage 1 to stage 2 and increased expected credit 
losses within stage 2. if instead the upside scenario was assigned a probability of 100%, the allowance account would decrease by dkk 0.4 billion  (2019: 
0.5 billion) compared to the base-case scenario. it should be noted that the expected credit losses in the individual scenarios (i.e. without the weighting) 
do not represent forecasts of expected credit losses (ecl).  
 
post-model adjustments 
management applies judgement when determining the need for post-model adjustments. at 31 december 2020, the post-model adjustments amounted 
to dkk 6.4 billion (2019: 4.0 billion). the post-model adjustments related primarily to the following types of risk: 
• 
specific macroeconomic risks on certain industries not fully captured by the expected credit loss model, for instance agriculture industry (for such 
industries, supplementary calculations are made in order to ensure sufficient impairment coverage)  
• 
non-linear downside macroeconomic risks, for instance in relation to the property market in copenhagen and other high growth areas (for which 
the macroeconomic forecasts used in the models are based on the property market as a whole) 
• 
portfolios where the credit risk assessment process has identified an underestimation of the expected credit losses 
• 
upcoming model changes that will impact the credit loss model  
• 
post-model adjustments including the immediate risks arising from the corona crisis introduced in the first quarter of 2020.  
 
following the significant impact on the expected credit losses from post-model adjustments, in the table below provides more information about the post-
model adjustments.

at 31 december 2019, the upside scenario represented a slightly better outlook than the base case scenario across the macroeconomic parameters, 
mainly to capture uncertainty to the upside. 
  
the base-case scenario enters with a probability of 60% (2019: 60%), the upside scenario with a probability of 15% (2019: 10%) and the downside 
scenario with a probability of 25% (2019: 30%). on the basis of these assessments, the allowance account at 31 december 2020 amounted to dkk 
22.6 billion (2019: 20.5 billion). if the base case scenario was assigned a probability of 100%, the allowance account would decrease dkk 0.4 billion 
(2019: 0.7 billion). compared to the base case scenario, the allowance account would increase dkk 1.7 billion (2019: 2.4 billion), if the downside scenario 
was assigned a probability of 100%. the increase reflects primarily the transfer of exposures from stage 1 to stage 2 and increased expected credit 
losses within stage 2. if instead the upside scenario was assigned a probability of 100%, the allowance account would decrease by dkk 0.4 billion  (2019: 
0.5 billion) compared to the base-case scenario. it should be noted that the expected credit losses in the individual scenarios (i.e. without the weighting) 
do not represent forecasts of expected credit losses (ecl).  
 
post-model adjustments 
management applies judgement when determining the need for post-model adjustments. at 31 december 2020, the post-model adjustments amounted 
to dkk 6.4 billion (2019: 4.0 billion). the post-model adjustments related primarily to the following types of risk: 
• 
specific macroeconomic risks on certain industries not fully captured by the expected credit loss model, for instance agriculture industry (for such 
industries, supplementary calculations are made in order to ensure sufficient impairment coverage)  
• 
non-linear downside macroeconomic risks, for instance in relation to the property market in copenhagen and other high growth areas (for which 
the macroeconomic forecasts used in the models are based on the property market as a whole) 
• 
portfolios where the credit risk assessment process has identified an underestimation of the expected credit losses 
• 
upcoming model changes that will impact the credit loss model  
• 
post-model adjustments including the immediate risks arising from the corona crisis introduced in the first quarter of 2020.  
 
following the significant impact on the expected credit losses from post-model adjustments, in the table below provides more information about the post-
model adjustments.

the post-model adjustments relating to the corona crisis concern industries directly affected by the corona crisis and for which the macroeconomic scenarios 
themselves do not lead to a sufficient increase in expected credit losses. it includes expected, but not yet materialised, credit deterioration in relation to the 
personal customers and commercial property industries in denmark as government support ends. this also includes retailing, hotels and restaurants (within 
the hotels, restaurants and leisure industry) as well as oil and gas (within the shipping, oil and gas industry). the post-model adjustments gradually increased 
during the quarters of 2020. the base case macroeconomic scenarios used in the quarters of 2020 all reflect a recovery in 2021, gradually becoming more 
positive as the period until recovery in 2021 shortens, thus leading to a reversal of the modelled expected credit losses. due to the continued significant 
uncertainty relating to the magnitude of the pandemic and to the extent to which government will continue to support the economies, management deemed it 
appropriate to increase the post-model adjustments relating to the corona crisis during the second half of 2020 to outweight the reversal of the modelled 
expected credit losses during the same period.

credit exposure from non-core lending activities 
 
the non-core business unit includes certain customer segments that are no longer considered part of the core business. the non-core unit is responsible 
for the controlled winding-up of this part of the loan portfolio. the portfolio consists primarily of loans to customers in the baltics and liquidity facilities for 
special purpose vehicles (spvs) and conduit structures. 
 
in december 2019 and january 2020, the group entered into agreements to sell portfolios of loans granted to personal customers in latvia and lithuania. 
the transactions were settled in the first half of 2020. in june 2020, the group entered into an agreement to sell a portfolio of estonian commercial loans 
managed by the lithuanian branch. the transaction was settled in october 2020. in the fourth quarter of 2020, the group entered into agreements to sell 
portfolios of commercial customers in latvia also managed by the lithuanian branch. settlement requires the approval of the competent authorities. until 
settlement, the portfolios are presented as loans held for sale. further information can be found in note g23. at the end of 2020, loans held for sale were 
included in the table below (a net exposure of dkk 416 million with the adjustment for credit risk of dkk 148 million presented as expected credit loss).

1 reverse transactions and other loans at fair value included as counterparty credit risk are loans at the trading units of corporates & institutions. these loans consist of reverse transactions of 
dkk 256.7 billion (2019: dkk 342.0 billion), of which dkk 50.0 billion relates to credit institutions and central banks (2019: dkk 23.6 billion), and other primarily short-term loans of dkk 2.8 
billion ((2019: dkk 1.1 billion), of which dkk 2.4 billion (2019: dkk 0 billion) relates to credit institutions and central banks.  
2 other unutilised commitments comprise private equity investment commitments and other obligations. 
 
counterparty credit risk (derivatives) 
derivatives are subject to credit risk. positive and negative fair values of derivatives with the same counterparty are offset in the balance sheet if certain 
conditions are fulfilled. the group has entered into master netting or similar agreements that include rights to additional set-off in the event of default by 
a counterparty. such agreements reduce the exposure further, but they do not qualify for offsetting under ifrss. the net current exposure to derivatives 
with positive market value after offsetting under master netting agreements amounted to dkk 109.6 billion (2019: dkk 76.4 billion) (see note g32). 
the exposure is broken down by rating category in the table below.

the group uses a range of measures to capture counterparty credit risk, including current exposure, potential future exposure (pfe) and exposure at default 
(ead). 
current exposure is a simple measure of counterparty credit risk exposure that takes into account only current mark-to-market values and collateral. 
 
customer-level counterparty risk is managed by means of pfe lines on a set of maturity buckets. it is measured at the 97.5% percentile for a set of future 
time horizons. pfe lines are approved by the relevant credit unit and all transactions are assumed to be held to contractual maturity. the group carries out 
daily counterparty credit risk measurement and monitoring as well as intraday line utilisation monitoring.  
 
the danish fsa approved the group’s simulation model for calculating the regulatory capital requirement for counterparty credit risk in 2015. more advanced 
measures such as ead, which is a regulatory measure, express potential future losses and are based on internal models for future scenarios of market data. 
ead figures are provided in the additional pillar iii disclosures (accessible at danskebank.com/investor-relations). 
 
an overview of counterparty credit risk exposures (at counterparty and portfolio levels) is reported to the executive leadership team and other senior 
management on a monthly basis. the group uses a simulation-based model to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure for the majority of its portfolio. 
 
the group makes fair value adjustments to cover the counterparty credit risk on derivatives with positive fair value (cva) that are recognised in the financial 
statements. for more information, see note g32.

market risk  
 
market risk is the risk of losses or gains caused by changes in the market values of the group’s financial assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items resulting 
from changes in market prices or rates. market risk affects the group’s financial statements through the valuation of on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet 
items; some of the group’s financial instruments, assets and liabilities are valued on the basis of market prices, while others are valued on the basis of market 
prices and valuation models developed by the group. in addition, net interest income generated through the non-trading portfolio will be affected by the level 
of interest rates. 
 
the group’s market risk management is intended to ensure proper oversight of all market risks, including both trading-related market risk and non-trading-
related market risk as well as market risk in relation to fair value adjustments. the market risk framework is designed to systematically identify, assess, 
monitor and report market risk.  
 
the group manages its market risk by means of three separate frameworks for the following areas: 
  
• 
trading-related activities at corporates & institutions (c&i) 
• 
fair value adjustments (xva) at corporates & institutions 
• 
non-trading portfolio at group treasury 
the group manages the market risk associated with its trading activities in the financial markets. in particular, the group hedges the market risk incurred 
from market-making activities and client flows by taking positions in financial instruments, assets and liabilities that offset this market risk. in addition, the 
group uses financial instruments to hedge the fair value adjustments (xva) in relation to derivatives trading. 
 
group treasury manages interest rate risks, and other market risks, associated with the assets and liabilities of the non-trading portfolio. group treasury 
also manages risks associated with the group’s defined benefit pension plans. 
 
the market risk at danica pension is managed separately. 
 
trading-related market risk at corporates & institutions 
the trading-related activities at corporates & institutions cover trading in fixed income products, derivatives, foreign exchange, money markets, debt capital 
markets and equities. corporates & institutions acts mainly as a market maker processing large client flows. 
 
the table below shows the var for the trading-related activities at corporates & institutions.

the group continued to maintain a low risk in its trading operations in 2020, with average trading-related market risk increasing from dkk 26 million in 
2019 to dkk 29 million in 2020. throughout the period, the risk related chiefly to fixed income products, which gave rise to interest rate risk and bond 
spread risk. because of substantial diversification, however, the two main risk factors hedged each other well. both average interest rate risk and average 
bond spread risk as well as equity risk increased in 2020 from 2019 levels. in addition, foreign exchange risk was more or less unchanged. 
 
market risk in relation to fair value adjustments 
the group’s fair value adjustments (xva) cover funding value adjustments (fva), credit value adjustments (cva) and debt value adjustments (dva). the 
group applies a market-implied approach that is in line with industry best practice. when managing xva, the group focuses on managing economic risk 
rather than regulatory capital. this means that the group recognises market risk on all counterparties and not just counterparties in scope for the cva risk 
charge. the group’s strategy is to continue developing the xva model so that it remains in line with best market practice.  
 
for the purposes of reducing p/l volatility caused by xva, the group pursues a strategy of hedging the most significant risk in the financial markets in 
order to maintain income stability and predictability under this framework. in practice, the group buys a hedge of offsetting interest rate swaps and cds 
contracts in the financial markets. the group hedges open foreign exchange risk under this framework. due to the non-linear nature of both cva and 
fva, the group has a significant interest rate vega exposure, which is only partially hedged. the fx vega exposure is limited and not hedged at the moment. 
the main risk of fva is the funding spread risk (the funding spread is set by group treasury). this part cannot easily be limited and hedged, but the group 
nevertheless endeavours to mitigate some of the funding spread risk through own debt issues. in addition, the group may maintain exposures to sovereign 
spread risk. 
 
market risk in relation to the non-trading portfolios at group treasury  
the group’s exposure to market risk in the non-trading portfolio originates mainly from interest rate risk in the banking book (irrbb). irrbb derives from 
providing the group’s core banking customers with conventional banking products and from the group’s funding and liquidity management activities at group 
treasury. in addition, the group holds a portfolio of unlisted shares relating mainly to private equity funds and banking-related investments.

market risk continued 
 
the group has entered into a structural fx hedge position to reduce the adverse effects on the cet1 capital ratio from exchange rate changes in sek, nok 
and eur (for more information see the section below on structual foreign exchange risk). aside from this, the group has an ambition of hedging all other fx 
exposures arising from the banking book balance sheet and group treasury activities, and thus having no significant open fx risk positions. 
 
interest rate risk in the banking book (irrbb) 
annually, the board of directors determines the group’s interest rate risk appetite. this framework is translated into a limit framework used for risk 
management purposes. the group alco is responsible for monitoring and managing the group’s irrbb exposure. while the group balance sheet risk 
committee discharges the second-line-of-defence obligations in overseeing the implementation and maintenance of the group-wide framework for 
managing the non-trading portfolio market risk. 
 
the table below shows the group’s total interest rate sensitivity in the banking book (economic value-based measure) measured as the change in the net 
present value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items in the banking book subject to a parallel interest rate curve shift of +100bp and -100bp. 
the sensitivity to falling interest rates decreased from a loss of dkk 2,681 million in 2019 to a loss of dkk 1,064 million at the end of 2020, while the 
sensitivity to rising interest rates decreased from a gain of dkk 4,433 million in 2019 to a gain of dkk 2,269 million at the end of 2020. the decrease 
was driven primarily by an increase in the average interest rate risk duration of the fixed rate assets while a combination of increases in demand deposits 
and a change in floor levels and model assumptions for demand deposits led to a moderate increase only in respect of the interest rate risk on liabilities. 
the net effect was a net decrease in interest rate risk.

earnings-at-risk (ear) is a regulatory measure that seeks to stress net interest income under a number of different scenarios using defined parameters. 
a constant balance-sheet approach is used for creating a base scenario over a 12-month time horizon. a number of different scenarios are then applied 
for the purpose of assessing the ear sensitivity. the ear measure complements the economic value interest rate measure, which measures the long-
term effect. at the end of december 2020, only two of the scenarios were causing a decline in the net interest income compared to the base case 
scenario. the worst case scenario was the ‘short rates up’ scenario, having a negative impact on ear of dkk 664 million. at the end of 2019, the worst 
case sceanario was a parallel downward yield curve shift of 1%, which also had a positive impact on the group’s ear of dkk 6 million compared to the 
base case scenario.  
 
the group uses a credit spread risk in the banking book measure based on a 10-day 99% var approach. partly due to the volatility experienced since 
the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic but also due to an increase in the volume and duration of the liquidity buffer bond portfolio at fair value through 
other comprehensive income, this measure increased to dkk 195 million at the end of 2020 (2019: dkk 99 million. 
 
structural foreign exchange risk 
the group’s cet1 capital is denominated in its domestic currency, dkk, while some of its assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies. 
although a fully matched foreign currency position will protect danske bank against losses from movements in exchange rates, the group’s cet1 capital 
ratio will fall if the domestic currency depreciates because of the imbalance between the cet1 capital in a particular foreign currency and the cet1 
capital required to support the rea denominated in that same currency. this risk is labelled structural foreign exchange risk. 
 
the group’s objective is to manage structural foreign exchange risk in order to reduce the potential effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on the cet1 
capital ratio in a manner that avoids income statement volatility, while at the same time acknowledging potential increased volatility in other 
comprehensive income. the group pursues a strategy of hedging the foreign exchange sensitivity of the cet1 capital ratio stemming from the allocated 
capital that reflects credit and operational risk reas in the three most significant balance sheet currencies (nok, sek, and eur). by nature, structural 
foreign exchange (hedge) positions are long-term and non-trading positions and they also remain relatively stable over time. 
 
regulatory capital for market risk 
the group mainly uses the internal model approach (ima) to measure the risk exposure amount (rea) used for determining the minimum capital 
requirement for market risk in the trading book. the ima comprises the value-at-risk (var) capital charge, the stressed value-at-risk (svar) capital 
charge and the incremental risk charge (irc). the group uses the internal var model to calculate the var and svar capital charges, whereas the irc is 
calculated on the basis of the incremental risk model. no diversification effects between capital charges are taken into account. 
 
the rea for the group’s minor exposures to commodity risk and collective investment undertakings is calculated according to the standardised approach.  
 
the rea for cva risk is measured mainly using the internal var model based on exposure calculations from the counterparty risk exposure model and 
allocated cds spread hedges. the risk exposure amount for cva risk from the group’s minor exposures to transactions not included in the counterparty 
credit risk exposure model is calculated according to the standardised approach.

liquidity risk  
 
liquidity risk is the risk of losses because funding costs become excessive, lack of funding prevents the group from maintaining its business model, or 
lack of funding prevents the group from fulfilling its payment obligations. 
 
accepting and managing liquidity risk is an integral part of the group’s business strategy. realkredit danmark and danica pension each manage their 
liquidity separately and are not included in the group’s general liquidity reporting. at realkredit danmark, the financing of mortgage loans through the 
issuance of listed mortgage bonds with matching conditions has eliminated liquidity risk in all material respects. danica pension’s balance sheet contains 
long-term life insurance liabilities and assets, a large part of which are invested in readily marketable bonds and shares. both companies are subject to 
statutory limits on their exposures to danske bank a/s. in the following, references to the group’s liquidity thus exclude realkredit danmark and danica 
pension with the exception of the group’s liquidity coverage ratio, which includes realkredit danmark data. 
 
markets and funding  
the accounting year of 2020 was marked by the corona crisis in many respects, including in the areas of liquidity and funding. with the global spread of 
contagion, market perceptions changed apruptly in march 2020, throwing financial markets into turmoil. with mounting concerns over the economic 
impact of the pandemic, many customers felt a need to build up liquidity buffers to cope with a potentially difficult situation. in particular, large corporate 
customers increased their deposits significantly. central banks established special facilities to meet the expected liquidity needs. these needs turned 
out to be less than anticipated, as the measures successfully pre-empted any concerns about inadequate liquidity. 
 
the increased economic uncertainty also contributed to greater credit risk and widening spreads on funding costs. due to the stability of its funding 
structure, the group did not depend on the funding market in the short term. as markets settled down during the summer, debt issuing resumed.  
 
at the end of 2020, the group’s liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) stood at 154 compared to 140% at the end of 2019.  
 
liquidity risk management 
at group level, liquidity management is based on the monitoring and management of short- and long-term liquidity risks. liquidity triggers make up a vital 
part of day-to-day liquidity management because they are used as early warnings of a potential liquidity crisis. the triggers are monitored by various 
functions across the group, depending on the type of trigger. liquidity management is organised according to the framework described in the following 
sections, although it is not limited to that framework. 
 
distance to default 
the principal aim of the group’s short-term risk management is to ensure that the liquidity reserve is sufficient to absorb the net effects of known future 
receipts and payments from current transactions. cash and bond holdings eligible for repo agreements with central banks are considered liquid assets. 
potential and expected outflows are monitored on an ongoing basis using different tools, notably the lcr. 
 
for liquidity and funding purposes, foreign currency is an important consideration. with its large market share in denmark, the group has a net deposit 
surplus in dkk (deposits exceed lending. the opposite is the case for sek and nok. (other currencies such as usd and gbp roughly balance out). the 
net deposit surplus in danish kroner is a valuable, stable funding source for the group. in addition to limits set by the board of directors and the group 
all risk committee, the group balance sheet risk committee sets overnight targets for each key currency. 
 
distance to default under stress 
the group conducts stress tests to measure its immediate liquidity risk and to ensure that it has sufficient time to respond to a crisis. the stress tests 
estimate liquidity risk in various scenarios, including three standard scenarios: a scenario specific to the group, a general market crisis scenario and a 
combination of the two.  
 
all stress tests are based on the assumption that the group does not reduce its lending activities. this means that existing lending activities are 
maintained and require funding. the degree of access to refinancing varies, depending on the scenario in question and the specific funding source. to 
assess the stability of the funding, the group considers maturity as well as behavioural assumptions.  
 
liquidity coverage ratio, aggregated and by currency 
the lcr requirement stipulates that financial institutions must have a liquidity reserve in excess of projected net outflows during a severe stress scenario 
lasting 30 days. by executive order, danish sifis are also subject to currency-specific liquidity requirements. the requirements apply individually and 
only for currencies that are significant to the individual bank. for danske bank, these currencies are usd and eur. though also significant, nok and sek 
are not subject to such requirements due to a high degree of interchangeability for dkk, nok and sek assets.

are not subject to such requirements due to a high degree of interchangeability for dkk, nok and sek assets.

market reliance 
managing reliance on wholesale deposits and market funding is a key concern for the group. such funding may be unstable, especially in the event of 
general market unrest or issues specific to danske bank. large funding needs can make the group vulnerable to investor sentiments, market stress and 
market dysfunctionalities. the size and maturity profile of wholesale funding must therefore be prudent. 
 
retail deposits, are a very important and stable funding source for the group. retail customers do not tend to make withdrawls on the basis of short-
term considerations, and most retail deposits are covered by a deposit guarantee scheme, which eliminates credit exposure to the bank.  
 
stress testing is also used to assess the group’s ability to withstand liquidity outflows when capital markets are inaccessible, i.e. market reliance. the 
assumed scenarios are different from the ones used to assess distance to default, especially with respect to time horizon. each month, the minimum 
reserve required to withstand a 12-month crisis scenario is calculated. 
 
funding sources 
the group monitors its funding mix to ensure that it is well-diversified in terms of funding sources, maturities and currencies. a diverse range of funding 
sources provides protection against market disruptions. the following tables break down funding sources by type and currency. it does not include 
mortgage bonds issued by realkredit danmark.

liquidity reserve 
the minimum size and the composition of the liquidity reserve are determined on the basis of the group’s capacity to meet its obligations in case of a 
stressed liquidity situation. the lcr regulation determines its minimum size and imposes requirements on its composition.  
 
danske bank’s liquidity reserve consists of liquid assets available in a stressed situation. assets received as collateral are included in the reserve, while 
assets used as collateral – or otherwise encumbered - are excluded. the table below shows the value of the group’s lcr liquidity reserve after the 
application of the statutory haircuts which may differ from the ones available in the market and the ones used for internal stress testing. most of the 
group’s bond holdings are highly liquid because they are repo eligible with central banks and in money markets. central bank eligibility is vital for intra-
day liquidity management and overnight liquidity facilities and also for determining liquidity in markets during stressed periods.

danica pension uses interest rate hedging to manage interest rate risk and maintain customer buffers. the interest rate used for discounting the 
technical provisions is the solvency ii discount curve. it is based primarily on the eur swap rate and also takes into account yields on danish mortgage 
bonds, credit bonds and government bonds. it is not possible for danica pension to invest in instruments that completely hedge the discount curve, and 
therefore some basis risk remains. the level of the long end of the discount curve, for which no reliable market data are available, is determined by the 
european insurance and occupational pensions authority (eiopa). derivatives used for hedging may give rise to counterparty credit risk, but this is 
mitigated by requiring counterparties to provide full collateral and by using many different counterparties with high ratings. furthermore, danica pension 
uses central clearing. 
 
the guaranteed life annuities included in the with-profits product give rise to longevity risk. this risk is generally not hedged since it is a natural element 
of the business model, but rather managed through prudent pricing and reserving. 
 
longevity risk is modelled in the solvency capital requirement calculation and reporting processes by use of a partial internal model approved by the the 
danish fsa. this model is based on the danish fsa’s life expectancy benchmark and longevity observations of danica pension’s policyholders.  
 
risk related to the unit-linked products 
approximately 80% of unit-linked policies have no financial guarantees. in these policies, the policyholders bear the investment risk. in the rest of the 
unit-linked policies, which consist mainly of danica balance policies, the policyholders have investment guarantees. the risk on these guarantees is 
managed by de-risking of the asset allocation at the individual policy level. this individual hedging strategy aims to ensure that sufficient funds are available 
to cover the guarantees even after a substantial decline in asset prices. danica pension’s activities in norway accounted for 4% of its total provisions at 
the end of 2020. in this market, danica pension offers mainly unit-linked products without guarantees, which gives rise to relatively limited risk from a 
group perspective. 
 
risk monitoring and reporting 
danica pension’s board of directors has set overall risk limits on the potential loss in a number of stress scenarios. danica pension’s risk management 
function monitors these limits on a daily basis. any breaches are reported by the cro to the alm committee and senior management. danica pension’s board 
of directors receives quarterly reports on the risk and solvency position, including stress and sensitivity figures. stress and sensitivities figures are also 
reported to danske bank a/s via group risk management (the wealth management cro organisation) and cfo area (capital management).  
 
danica pension’s a solvency coverage ratio (scr) was 191% at 31 december 2020 (2019: 190%). the table below shows the effect on different risk 
factors that results in an scr of 125%. the interest rate risk stress is capped at 2%.

the danish market for pension products continues to be competitive, with little prospect of increases in total market volume. the market is dominated 
by a small number of large commercial and mutual pension insurance companies with similar product offerings. the low-yield market environment does 
not directly influence the short-term financial stability of danica pension because the interest rate risk on all liabilities is hedged, and there are no material 
differences in the interest rate sensitivities for accounting and solvency purposes. the main difficulty lies in a slower build-up of assets under 
management and customer buffers, which may adversely affect income in the long run.

notes – danske bank group – risk management 
insurance risk  
 
the group’s insurance risk consists of the risks originating from its ownership of danica pension. this includes market risk, life insurance risks and non-
financial risks. the group aims at maintaining a predictable risk profile. the insurance risk framework is governed by danica pension’s board of directors. 
on a daily basis, danica pension’s risk management function monitors the risk and asset-liability management (alm) limits set by its board of directors 
as well as the solvency capital requirements. the risk management function also, follows up on investment limits and calculates key risk figures for 
asset-liability management (alm) purposes. 
 
the group’s net income from insurance business is derived primarily from 
• 
the risk allowance from conventional life insurance business with guaranteed benefits (with-profit policies) 
• 
unit-linked business 
• 
health and accident business 
• 
return on assets in which the shareholders’ equity of danica pension is invested 
 
operating under the solvency ii regulations, danica pension provides pensions as well as life and health insurance products in denmark and norway. in 
denmark, danica pension’s main product offerings are with-profit policies and unit-linked policies. 
 
danish with-profits policies have guaranteed benefits based on a technical rate of interest. the policyholders earn interest at a rate set for each year at 
a discretion of the life insurance company, and the rate can be changed at any time. the difference between the actual (set) interest rate and the return 
on the policyholders’ (collective) assets in a given year is added to the collective bonus potential and can be used as a buffer. the with-profits products 
are called danica traditionel. the product is closed for new business and the portfolio is thus in run-off.  
 
unit-linked policies are policies in which investments are allocated to the policyholders, and they can then decide whether to invest their pension savings 
themselves or let danica pension invest the savings. the offering includes ‘life cycle’ products that allocate to lower risk assets as the desired retirement 
date approaches. in unit-linked policies, the policyholders receive the actual return on the investments rather than a fixed interest rate. some of the unit-
linked products give the policyholders the option to have their benefits guaranteed.  
 
the risk allowance is the annual return that danica pension may book from its conventional life insurance business (danica traditionel). the booking of 
the risk allowance is governed by the danish fsa’s executive order on the contribution principle. under these rules, danica pension may book a risk 
allowance of the technical provisions (depending on the individual interest rate group) as long as any difference between the technical basis and the risk 
allowance can be covered by the bonus potentials or the profit margin.  
 
according to the danish fsa’s executive order on the contribution principle, policyholders’ funds in danica traditionel must be ring-fenced in groups 
with generally the same technical rate of interest, insurance risk and expenses. danica pension has individual investment and hedging strategies for each 
group. furthermore, the collective bonus potential, the risk allowance, etc., are also determined for each group individually. 
 
danica pension’s risks 
as part of its product offerings, danica pension provides guaranteed life annuities; insurance against death, disability and accident; and guaranteed 
benefits at retirement. this exposes the group to insurance risks such as longevity and disability risks as well as to market risk.  
 
lapse risk (customers leaving danica pension or ceasing to pay premiums) is the most prominent type of insurance risk since danica pension’s 
profitability depends highly on the volume of customers and assets under management. danica pension has a large offering of life annuities that will pay 
fixed pension benefits during a policyholder’s lifetime, and this makes longevity risk the second most prominent type of underwriting risk for the group. 
most pension products come with life and disability insurance, which entails exposure to mortality and disability risk. health and accident insurance 
policies are typically shorter, so slowly materialising risks can be handled by means of repricing or contract termination. 
 
in with-profits policies, the policyholders have guaranteed benefits. the return on invested customer savings is allocated to collective buffer accounts 
owned by customers. the balance of these accounts is then gradually transferred to the individual accounts in subsequent years by means of a bonus 
allocation mechanism. negative investment returns or increases in technical provisions due to lower interest rates or other risks factors reduce the 
collective buffer accounts. hence, the market risk on investments is borne by the customers to the extent that negative returns can be covered by the 
collective buffer accounts. once the buffer accounts have been depleted, negative investment returns on customer savings will force danica pension to 
step in with funds to ensure that it is possible to provide the benefits guaranteed to the policyholders. danske bank a/s has no obligation to provide 
capital to danica pension to help re-establish its solvency position. danica pension can issue and has previously issued capital in the form of restricted 
tier 1 and tier 2 instrumets.  
 
in unit-linked policies, the policyholders bear the investment risk. however, losses may reduce the assets under management and thus deplete future 
asset management fees in the long term. if a guarantee is attached to a policy, danica pension bears the risk for this guarantee. 
 
risks related to danish with-profits products 
the main source of risk at danica pension is the danish with-profits pension product. this product offers policyholders an annuity or a lump sum of a 
guaranteed minimum amount in nominal terms, which means that they participate in a collective investment pool. high returns may lead to higher benefits 
than those guaranteed. the present value of the guaranteed benefits depends on the level of the discount curve, which is defined under solvency ii and 
based on market rates. if the value of the assets falls below the present value of the liabilities, danica pension will have to cover the shortfall. managing 
the with-profits product thus involves a combination of managing the risks on behalf of the policyholders and managing the risk that danica pension will 
have to cover losses.

notes – danske bank group – risk management 
non-financial risk  
 
non-financial risk is the risk of financial losses or gains, regulatory impact, reputational impact or customer impact resulting from inadequate or failed 
internal processes, people or systems or from external events, including legal and compliance risks. according to the group’s risk taxonomy as set out 
in its enterprise risk management (erm) framework, non-financial risk consists of six risk categories: model risk, operational risk, technology risk, financial 
crime risk, regulatory compliance risk and financial control and strategic risk. in addition, reputational risk and conduct risk are present across the 
taxonomy and may arise as any or all other risk types materialise. 
 
implementation of the non-financial risk management framework is linked to building and maintaining a strong risk and compliance culture across the 
group. the group has a suite of mandatory training courses for alle employees (including the executive leadership team). the internal website “doright” 
allows employees to share their concerns and is supported by a group-wide whistlblower system. the executive leadership team uses a set of key 
performance indicators (kpis) to measure the risk and compliance culture. 
 
the group’s approach to non-financial risk management is set out in a number of governing documents. the group non-financial risk policy is the 
overarching policy and lays down the principles and responsibilities for managing non-financial risks across the three lines of defence. supplementary 
policies are in place and reviewed annually to ensure alignment with regulatory developments. the non-financial risk tolerances were enhanced and 
defined at a more granular level in alignment with the erm taxonomy in 2020 with scheduled implementation in the first half of 2021.  
 
in order to provide a strong governance structure and effectively cover specific non-financial risk categories, the group all risk committee has a number 
of non-financial risk sub-committees, including the operational risk committee (orco), the conduct & reputational committee (crp) and the model risk 
management committee (mrmc). furthermore, non-financial risks are overseen by two of the board of directors’ committees: the risk committee and 
the conduct & compliance committee. 
 
risk assessment 
the group´s standard approach to risk assessment of its non-financial risks and controls is in line with industry standards and comprises the following 
steps: non-financial risk and control identification, inherent risk assessment, assessment of controls, residual risk assessment and definition of mitigating 
actions. the group also conducts scenario analyses to understand exposure to low-frequency high-severity events. results from risk assessments and 
stress tests are used as input for the group’s internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap).  
 
in 2020, the group continued to make progress on its 2023 better bank ambitions towards customers, employees, shareholders and society. risks 
related to the better bank transformation are identified, assessed and managed in accordance with the group’s standards on an ongoing basis. the 
performed risk assessments ensure that changes are embedded into the risk management process and that appropriate mitigating actions are identified 
and implemented. business units are in charge of implementing and executing on the strategy and taking corrective action in relation to deviations and 
risks relating to strategy operationalisation. the implementation approach is tested against the group’s risk appetite to ensure alignment. 
 
event management 
event management aims to ensure timely and appropriate handling of detected events in order to minimise the potential impact on the group and its 
stakeholders and to prevent reoccurrence. furthermore, event management allows timely, accurate and complete information for both internal and 
external reporting, including timely notification to relevant supervisory authorities. non-financial risk events are registered, categorised and handled 
according to reporting thresholds, and risk assessment and root-cause analysis are performed to effectively address underlying risks and provide 
mitigation plans. the group strives to learn from materialised events and observed near-misses to continually improve its operational risk management 
framework. 
 
there is a substantial focus on strengthening the control environment across the group through a number of programmes to address a combination of 
danish fsa orders and observed control weaknesses and to adhere to regulatory requirements. in 2020, a new central unit was established with the 
task of overseeing the remediation of identified legacy issues and ensuring a transparent and timely communication to customers and other stakeholders. 
 
as in 2019, the majority of loss events in 2020 fell into two broad categories: execution, delivery and process management and clients, products and 
business practices. there were losses relating to legacy systems and limitations in manual processes as well as product and services-related events, 
significant non-financial risk events across the group are monitored and reported to the executive leadership team, the board of directors, the danish 
fsa and, where applicable, to relevant local fsas.  
 
operational resilience 
operational resilience is a key area of focus for the group, including incorporation into the decision-making process. the group defines operational 
resilience as the ability to prepare for, effectively respond to, and learn from disruptive events and adapt to changing conditions in order to continue 
providing critical services to customers and society in the presence of operational stress. furthermore, the group considers operational resilience as 
broader-than-traditional business continuity planning and disaster recovery abilities.  
 
the crisis management structure has proven to be robust and flexible enough to handle the dynamic nature of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic by 
ensuring rapid collection of information, reporting, analysis, decision-making and implementation processes. the group is applying the lessons learned 
from the corona crisis for the purpose of strengthening its operational resilience.

cyber security 
the volume and sophistication of cyber-related attacks continue to grow. information security (including cybersecurity) is identified as a top risk concern 
across global and nordic peers, and this trend is expected to continue. this type of attack remains an effective method for criminals to monetise illicit 
access into an organisation, resulting in data leaks when an organisation is unwilling to pay. the board of directors and the executive leadership team 
acknowledge the materiality of the risk posed by cyber-related attacks, and continue to invest in maturing the group's ability to prevent, detect, respond 
to and recover from cyber-related attacks. in response to the increasing threat of cyber-related attacks, the group has mobilised a multi-year 
transformation sponsored by the executive leadership team to continue to mature the group's ability to mitigate the risks posed by these threats. the 
management of cyber-related risks is covered within the group's overall risk management framework, as they may prevent the bank from achieving its 
objectives. governance structures and methodologies to oversee, prioritise and undertake risk mitigation activity related to cyber-related attacks are in 
place to ensure that the focus remains on this area. 
 
financial crime 
the group’s business units and functions constitute the first line of defence and are responsible for identifying financial crime risks and for having 
appropriate processes and controls in place to ensure that risks are identified, assessed, managed and reported appropriately. the financial crime 
compliance function at group compliance constitutes the second line of defence and is responsible for designing frameworks and policies and for 
providing independent oversight and challenges to ensure that financial crime risks are managed effectively.  
 
the group is undertaking a multi-year enhancement programme to materially upgrade its financial crime framework. the group has embarked on a 
comprehensive transformation, covering all aspects of an effective control environment. the programme covers areas such as transaction monitoring, 
sanctions screening, know-your-customer processes, suspicious activity investigation and reporting, employee training, etc. the aim of the enhancement 
programme is to ensure that the group has a financial crime control framework which (i) meets the regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which 
the group operates and (ii) manages the group’s inherent risk in line with group risk appetite, and this will be achieved by leveraging international market 
practice. the enhancement programme is tracked through formal governance and monthly status updates are provided to the group’s executive 
leadership team and the danish fsa. regular updates are also provided to the group’s conduct & compliance committee (ccc) and the board of 
directors.  
 
combatting financial crime effectively requires strong industry collaboration in order to ensure the security and soundness of the entire financial system. 
in 2020, the group was an active participant in industry initiatives across the nordics, which aim to make the public and private sector, collectively, more 
effective in reaching the common goal. 
 
regulatory compliance 
group compliance provides primary and independent second line oversight of regulatory compliance risk, including risks in relation to market integrity, 
fair treatment of customers, data protection and is developing its oversight capabilities for it risks. group compliance assesses the framework in place 
across other second-line-of-defence units and independent oversight/control functions for the purpose reviewing their methods and procedures to 
ensure adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations. the group has a key focus on compliance gaps indentified in its control environment and on 
ensuring that risks are proactively managed on an ongoing basis, including risks arising from regulatory change. 
 
conduct risk 
the supporting risk management framework is being developed and implemented through the conduct programme, established in 2020 as a key 
strategic initiative in the group’s better bank transformation programme. the framework will be developed by compliance, but it will be tailored and 
implemented by the business in the first line of defence. a new conduct risk policy, instructions and risk tolerance statements are being developed for 
implementation in 2021. the key areas that will dominate implementation alongside the framework development in 2021 have been identified as (1) 
treatment of vulnerable customers, (2) improving transparency around products and services and (3) fairness and consistency of the pricing framework.

financial statements – danske bank a/s  
 
the financial statements of the parent company, danske bank a/s, are prepared in accordance with the danish financial business act and the danish 
fsa’s executive order no. 281 of 26 march 2014 on financial reports for credit institutions and investment companies, etc. as amended by executive 
order no. 707 of 1 june 2016, executive order no. 1043 of 5 september 2017 and executive order no. 1441 of 3 december 2018. 
 
note g2(a) provides further information on changes in accounting policies implemented as at 1 january 2020. except for these changes, danske bank 
a/s has not changed its significant accounting policies from those applied in the annual report 2019. 
 
the accounting policies applied are identical to the group’s ifrs accounting principles, see note g1(a)-(c), with the following exception: 
• 
domicile property (except right-of-use assets) is measured (revalued) at its estimated fair value through other comprehensive income. 
 
the estimated fair value of domicile property is determined in accordance with the danish fsa’s executive order on financial reports for credit 
institutions and investment companies, etc. 
 
holdings in subsidiaries are measured on the basis of the equity method. net profit from these undertakings is recognised under income from associates 
and group undertakings. 
 
the format of the parent company’s financial statements is not identical to the format of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with ifrs. 
 
the table below shows the differences in net profit and shareholders’ equity between the ifrs consolidated financial statements and the parent 
company’s financial statements presented in accordance with danish fsa rules.

in 2020, ‘domicile properties’ includes an adjustment in net profit related to investment properties previously held by danica pension and included as 
assets under insurance contracts in the financial statements for danske bank group. as danske bank occupied more than 10% of the properties, they 
were accounted for as domicile property in danske bank group and danske bank a/s. in the consolidated financial statements for danske bank group, 
domicile property is measured using the cost method, and a gain on the sale of those properties of dkk 76 million, net of tax, was recognised in the 
income statement. under the revaluation method used in the financial statements for danske bank a/s, there was no gain on the sale.

estonia matter 
danske bank remains in dialogue with various authorities regarding the terminated non-resident portfolio at the bank’s estonian branch. this includes criminal 
and regulatory investigations by authorities in estonia, denmark, france and the united states. the bank continues to cooperate with all authorities.  
 
in 2018, the estonian office of the prosecutor general opened a criminal investigation into former employees of the estonian branch. 
 
in november 2018, danske bank was preliminary charged by the danish state prosecutor for serious economic and international crime (“sØik”) with 
violating the danish aml act on four counts all relating to the estonian branch in the period from 1 february 2007 to the end of january 2016. in october 
2020, sØik added violation of section 71 of the danish financial business act for governance and control failures in the period from 1 february 2006 to the 
end of 2017 to the preliminary charges. 
 
in february 2019, danske bank was placed under formal investigation by an investigating judge of the tribunal de grande instance de paris in the context of 
an on-going french criminal investigation and on the grounds of money laundering suspicions relating to certain transactions in the terminated portfolio of 
non-resident customers of the bank’s estonian branch, amounting to around dkk 160 million and performed between 2007 and 2014. the bank has posted 
bail in the amount of dkk 80 million. 
 
in december 2020, danske bank was informed by the u.s. department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control (“ofac”) that it had decided to close 
its investigation of danske bank in relation to the estonia case with no action. ofac is the u.s. authority responsible for civil enforcement of u.s. sanctions. 
the decision does not preclude ofac from taking future enforcement action should new or additional information warrant renewed attention. 
 
the bank is reporting to, responding to and cooperating with various authorities, including sØik, the u.s. department of justice (doj) and the u.s. securities 
and exchange commission (sec), relating to the bank’s estonian branch. the internal investigation work that the bank had planned to complete during 2020 
has been finalised and the bank has reported the findings to relevant authorities. the bank continues to fully cooperate and will provide the authorities with 
further information if and when requested. the overall timing of the authorities’ investigations remains unknown and is not within the bank’s control. it is not 
yet possible to reliably estimate the timing, form of resolution, or amount of potential settlement or fines, which could be material. 
 
based on orders from the danish fsa, danske bank’s solvency need has been increased in 2018 by a pillar ii add-on of in total dkk 10 billion to ensure 
adequate capital coverage of the increased compliance and reputational risks in relation to the estonian aml matter. 
 
on 9 january 2019, an action was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york by an alleged holder of danske bank’s 
american depositary receipts, representing its ordinary shares, against the bank and certain of its officers and former officers and/or directors. the 
complaint alleges that the defendants violated section 10(b) and section 20(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934 by, among other things, making 
false and misleading statements and/or failing to disclose adverse information regarding the bank’s business and operations in relation to aml matters 
relating to the bank’s estonian branch and related matters. the complaint seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the 
bank’s american depositary receipts between 9 january 2014 and 29 april 2019. on 24 august 2020, the court granted the motion and dismissed 
all claims against the bank on three independent grounds. on 23 september 2020, the plaintiffs filed an appeal of this ruling to the second circuit. the 
bank intends to oppose that appeal, and a decision is expected in the second half of 2021.the bank intends to defend itself against these claims. the 
timing of the completion of the lawsuit and the outcome are uncertain.

p26. contingent liabilities continued 
 
on 3 march 2019, a court case was initiated against danske bank for approval of a class action lead by a newly formed association with the aim to 
represent former and current shareholders in a liability action relating to the estonian aml matter. on 21 january 2021, the court dismissed the case 
because it did not fulfil the criteria for being approved as a class action. the bank expects that the association will seek to appeal the dismissal. the 
appeal, if any, would not be decided until late 2021 at the earliest. in march 2019 (153), october 2019 (60), january 2020 (9), and march 2020 (38) 
and in september 2020 (55), in total 315 separate cases were initiated against the bank with a total claim amount of approximately dkk 7.5 billion. on 
27 december 2019 (63) and on 4 september 2020 (30), two separate claims were filed by 93 investors against danske bank with a total claim amount 
of approximately dkk 1.7 billion. on 2 september 2020, 20 separate claims were filed by 20 investors against danske bank with a total claim amount 
of approximately dkk 1.1 billion. on 18 september 2020, one case was filed by 201 investors with a total claim value of approximately dkk 2.1 billion. 
on 18 september 2020, one case was filed against the bank (and the bank's former ceo, thomas f. borgen) by two investors with a total claim amount 
of dkk 10 million. these court actions relate to alleged violations in the bank’s branch in estonia of the rules on prevention of money laundering and/or 
alleged failure to timely inform the market of such violations (and in one claim, also market manipulation). 209 of the 315 cases filed in the period from 
march 2019 to september 2020 have been referred to the eastern high court. the remaining 106 cases are currently stayed before the copenhagen 
city court. the bank intends to defend itself against these claims. the timing of completion of any such lawsuits (pending or threatening) and their 
outcome are uncertain. 
 
on 20 february 2020, danske bank received a procedural notification in a case initiated against thomas f. borgen by 74 institutional investors, and 
funded by the litigation funder deminor recovery services. the total claim amount is approximately dkk 2.7 billion. under danish law, the purpose of a 
procedural notification is to make a formal reservation of rights to bring a potential claim against the notified party in the future. 
 
other 
owing to its business volume, danske bank is continually a party to various other lawsuits and disputes and has an ongoing dialogue with public 
authorities, such as the danish fsa on other matters. on 14 november 2019, danske bank was preliminarily charged by sØik for violating the danish 
executive order on investor protection in connection with the flexinvest fri case. danske bank has cooperated fully with sØik and in november 2020 
accepted a fine of dkk 9 million after which the matter has been closed. in general, danske bank does not expect the outcomes of any of these other 
pending lawsuits and disputes or its dialogue with public authorities to have any material effect on its financial position. provisions for litigations are 
included in other liabilities.

report of the danske bank group for 2020.
the consolidated fi nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu, and the parent company fi nancial statements have been prepared in accordance

cash fl ows for the fi nancial year 2020. moreover, in our opinion, the management’s report includes a fair review of 
developments in the group’s and the parent company’s operations and fi nancial position and describes the signifi cant 
risks and uncertainty factors that may affect the group and the parent company.
the management will submit the annual report to the general meeting for approval.

to the shareholders of danske bank a/s
opinion
we have audited the consolidated fi nancial statements and the parent fi nancial statements of danske bank a/s for 
the fi nancial year 1 january 2020 to 31 december 2020, pages 74-237, which comprise the income statement, 
statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of capital and notes, including the summary of 
signifi cant accounting policies, for the group as well as for the parent, and the cash fl ow statement of the group. 
the consolidated fi nancial statements are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards 
as adopted by the eu and additional danish disclosure requirements for listed fi nancial companies, and the parent 
fi nancial statements are prepared in accordance with the danish financial business act.
in our opinion, the consolidated fi nancial statements give a true and fair view of the group’s fi nancial position at 
31 december 2020, and of its fi nancial performance and cash fl ows for the fi nancial year 1 january 2020 to 31 
december 2020 in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and additional 
danish disclosure requirements for listed fi nancial companies.
also, in our opinion, the parent fi nancial statements give a true and fair view of the parent’s fi nancial position at 31 
december 2020, and of its fi nancial performance for the fi nancial year 1 january 2020 to 31 december 2020 in 
accordance with the danish financial business act.
our opinion is consistent with our audit book comments issued to the audit committee and the board of directors.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing (isas) and additional requirements 
applicable in denmark. our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the 
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated fi nancial statements and the parent fi nancial statements 
section of this auditor’s report. we are independent of the group in accordance with the international ethics 
standards board of accountants’ code of ethics for professional accountants (iesba code) and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark, and we have fulfi lled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
to the best of our knowledge and belief, we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services as referred to in 
article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 537/2014.
we were appointed auditors of danske bank a/s for the fi rst time on 18 march 2015 for the fi nancial year 2015. 
we have been reappointed annually by decision of the general meeting for a total contiguous engagement period of 6 
years up to and including the fi nancial year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signifi cance in our audit of the 
consolidated fi nancial statements and the parent fi nancial statements for the fi nancial year 1 january 2020 to 31 
december 2020. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated fi nancial statements 
and the parent fi nancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.

key audit matters
how the matters were addressed in our audit
regulatory investigations and litigation relating to anti-money laundering (“aml”)
the regulatory investigations and litigation in respect of the non-
resident portfolio in the estonian branch, and any potential regulatory 
action as a result of the need to improve the quality and the effi ciency 
of the aml controls in general, are deemed to be a key audit matter as 
the recognition and measurement of provisions and the measurement 
and disclosure of contingent liabilities require signifi cant judgements by 
management.
the signifi cant judgements include considering whether to record a 
provision for future potential fi nes or settlements in respect of the 
non-resident portfolio in the estonian branch by assessing whether the 
criteria for recognition of an liability is met at 31 december 2020 by 
determining whether:
•  it is more likely than not that an economic outfl ow will occur in 
relation to the investigations and litigation; and
•  the amount of the payment (or other economic outfl ow) can be 
reliably estimated.
the timing of the completion of the investigations, the outcome and the 
subsequent discussions with the authorities continue to be uncertain. 
at present, management consider that it is not yet possible to reliably 
estimate the timing or amount of any potential settlement or fi nes, 
which could be material.
management has provided further information about anti-money 
laundering including regulatory investigations and litigation in note g27 
to the consolidated fi nancial statements.
we have considered: management’s assessment as to whether the 
criteria for recognition of an liability is met, including a provision for 
future potential fi nes or settlements, the disclosure of contingent 
liabilities; and the assumptions made.
our audit procedures included:
•  testing of key controls over the identifi cation, recording and 
disclosure of exposures to aml breaches of anti-money laundering 
regulation arising from the non-resident portfolio in the estonian 
branch including management’s review of the appropriateness 
of the provision and disclosure when assessed against ias 37 
provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
•  making enquiries of members of the executive board, the board of 
directors, the head of legal and the head of compliance.
•  inspecting and assessing correspondence from the regulatory 
authorities.
•  inspecting and assessing legal claims made against the group.
•  making enquiries of the group’s third party legal advisers and 
examining correspondence between the legal advisers and the 
group.
•  attending relevant meetings with the bank including those 
conducted with the group’s third party legal advisers.
•  inspecting and analysing management’s responses made to 
regulatory authorities on the progress of the group’s aml 
programme.
•  inspecting and analysing reports by the group’s control functions on 
the adequacy of the current state of the group’s aml controls.
•  inspecting and analysing reports on the progress of the group’s 
aml programme.
impairment charges for loans and provisions for guarantees
loans for the group amounted to dkk 2,047,930 million at 31 
december 2020 (dkk 2,150,059 million at 31 december 2019), and 
the total allowance account for the group amounted to dkk 23,342 
million at 31 december 2020 (dkk 21,313 million at 31 december 
2019).
measurement of loan impairment charges for loans and provisions 
for guarantees is deemed a key audit matter as the determination of 
assumptions for expected credit losses is highly subjective due to the 
level of judgement applied by management.
the most signifi cant judgements are:
•  assumptions used in the expected credit loss models to assess 
the credit risk related to the exposure and the expected future cash 
fl ows of the customer.
•  timely identifi cation of exposures with signifi cant increase in credit 
risk and credit impaired exposures.
•  valuation of collateral and assumptions of future cash fl ows on 
manually assessed credit-impaired exposures.
•  post-model adjustments for particular high-risk portfolios, which are 
not appropriately captured in the expected credit loss model.
•  effects of corona crisis in relation to the signifi cant judgements listed 
above.
management has provided further information about the loan 
impairment charges and provisions for guarantees in notes g1(b), 
g11, g15, g16 and risk management to the consolidated fi nancial 
statements.
based on our risk assessment and industry knowledge, we have 
examined the impairment charges for loans and provisions for 
guarantees and evaluated the methodology applied as well as the 
assumptions made according to the description of the key audit matter.
our examination included the following elements:
•  testing of key controls over assumptions used in the expected credit 
loss models to assess the credit risk related to the exposure and the 
expected future cash fl ows of the customer.
•  obtaining and substantively testing evidence to support the 
assumptions used in the expected credit loss models concerning 
methods applied to derive loss given default.
•  testing of key controls over timely identifi cation of exposures with 
signifi cant increase in credit risk and timely identifi cation of credit 
impaired exposures.
•  obtaining and substantively testing evidence of timely identifi cation 
of exposures with signifi cant increase in credit risk and timely 
identifi cation of credit impaired exposures.
•  testing of key controls over models and manual processes for 
valuation of collateral and assumptions of future cash fl ows.
•  obtaining and substantively testing evidence to support appropriate 
determination of assumptions for loan impairment charges and 
provisions for guarantees including valuation of collateral and 
assumptions of future cash fl ows on manually assessed credit 
impaired exposures.
•  testing of key controls over post-model adjustments applied to 
manage non-linearity that are not included in the modelled expected 
credit losses
•  obtaining and substantively testing evidence of post-model 
adjustments for high-risk portfolios with particular focus on the 
methodology applied, evidence of assumptions-setting processes 
and the consistency thereof by:
 
 •  assessing the key developments since last year against industry 
standards and historical data.
 
 •  assessing the appropriateness of the different identifi ed post-
model adjustments compared with the embedded macro forecasts 
applied in the expected credit loss models.
 
 •  challenging the methodologies applied by using our industry 
knowledge and experience.
•  challenging the inclusion of corona crisis effects on the above.

key audit matters
how the matters were addressed in our audit
measurement of liabilities under insurance contracts
liabilities under insurance contracts for the group amounted to 
dkk 591,930 million at 31 december 2020 (dkk 535,891 million 
at 31 december 2019).
measurement of liabilities under insurance contracts is deemed a key 
audit matter as the determination of assumptions for the measurement 
of insurance contract liabilities requires management to apply 
judgements about future events.
changes in assumptions and the methodology applied may have a 
material impact on the measurement of liabilities under insurance 
contracts.
the most signifi cant judgements are:
•  determining disability rates, mortality rates and surrender 
probabilities.
•  assumptions related to regulatory and reporting requirements, 
including risk and interest.
management has provided further information about liabilities under 
insurance contracts in notes g1(b) and g18 to the consolidated 
fi nancial statements.
based on our risk assessment, we have examined the valuation of 
liabilities under insurance contracts and evaluated the methodology 
applied and the assumptions made.
our examination included the following elements, where we also made 
use of our internationally qualifi ed actuaries:
•  testing of key controls over the actuarial models, data collection and 
analysis and the assumptions-setting processes.
•  evaluating the disability and mortality rates and surrender 
probabilities used in the calculation against historical data and 
market practice.
•  assessing the key changes in the assumptions against regulatory 
and reporting requirements and industry standards.
•  analysing developments, particularly within risk, interest and cost 
results by using our industry knowledge and experience.
fair value measurement of derivatives
derivatives classifi ed as assets for the group amounted to 
dkk 379,566 million at 31 december 2020 (dkk 293,980 million 
at 31 december 2019) and derivatives classifi ed as liabilities for the 
group amounted to dkk 366,985 million at 31 december 2020 
(dkk 299,695 million at 31 december 2019) for the group.
of derivative assets and liabilities held by the group those with 
non-observable inputs held at 31 december 2020 amounted to 
dkk 3,547 million (dkk 5,070 million at 31 december 2019) and 
dkk 3,684 million (dkk 4,853 million at 31 december 2019), 
respectively.
measurement of derivatives with non-observable inputs is deemed 
a key audit matter, as they require management to apply signifi cant 
judgements in:
•  determining the assumptions to be used to calculate and validate 
the market values.
•  identifying the most relevant market data for the models.
changes in the models may have a signifi cant impact on the 
measurement of derivatives.
management has provided further information about fair value 
measurement of derivatives in notes g1(b), g12 and g33 to the 
consolidated fi nancial statements.
based on our risk assessment, we have examined the valuation carried 
out by management and evaluated the methodology applied and the 
assumptions made.
our examination included the following elements:
•  testing of the independent pricing controls over derivatives with non-
observable inputs.
•  using our own internationally qualifi ed valuation experts, re-
calculating the carrying amounts on a sample basis by using 
independent data for derivatives with limited observable market 
data.
•  challenging the relevant market data used to calculate and validate 
the fair value of derivatives with non-observable inputs by:
 
 •  using our industry knowledge and experience to challenge the 
assumptions.
 
 •  assessing key assumptions against industry standards and 
historical data.

statement on the management’s report
management is responsible for the management’s report.
our opinion on the consolidated fi nancial statements and the parent fi nancial statements does not cover the 
management’s report, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the consolidated fi nancial statements and the parent fi nancial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the management’s report and, in doing so, consider whether the management’s report is 
materially inconsistent with the consolidated fi nancial statements and the parent fi nancial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the management’s report provides the information required under 
the danish financial business act.
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that the management’s report is in accordance with the 
consolidated fi nancial statements and the parent fi nancial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the danish financial business act. we did not identify any material misstatement of the management’s 
report.
management’s responsibilities for the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements and the parent ﬁ nancial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated fi nancial statements that give a true and fair view in 
accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and additional danish disclosure 
requirements for listed fi nancial companies, as well as for the preparation of parent fi nancial statements that give a 
true and fair view in accordance with the danish financial business act, and for such internal control as management 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated fi nancial statements and parent fi nancial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the consolidated fi nancial statements and the parent fi nancial statements, management is responsible 
for assessing the group’s and the parent’s ability to continue as a going concern, for disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern, and for using the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the consolidated 
fi nancial statements and the parent fi nancial statements unless management either intends to liquidate the group or the 
parent or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements and the parent ﬁ nancial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated fi nancial statements and the parent 
fi nancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with isas and the additional requirements applicable in denmark will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to infl uence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these consolidated fi nancial statements and these parent fi nancial statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and the additional requirements applicable in denmark, we exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. we also:
•   identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated fi nancial statements and the parent 
fi nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of not detecting 
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•   obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s 
and the parent’s internal control.
danske bank / annual report 2020
243
•   evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management.
•   conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
consolidated fi nancial statements and the parent fi nancial statements, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signifi cant doubt on the group’s 
and the parent’s ability to continue as a going concern. if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated fi nancial statements 
and the parent fi nancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions may 
cause the group and the parent to cease to continue as a going concern.
•   evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated fi nancial statements and the parent 
fi nancial statements, including the disclosures in the notes, and whether the consolidated fi nancial statements and 
the parent fi nancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and 
fair view.
•   obtain suffi cient appropriate audit evidence regarding the fi nancial information of the entities or business activities 
within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated fi nancial statements. we are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit. we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of 
the audit and signifi cant audit fi ndings, including any signifi cant defi ciencies in internal control that we identify during our 
audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and, where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
signifi cance in the audit of the consolidated fi nancial statements and the parent fi nancial statements of the current 
period and are therefore the key audit matters. we describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected 
to outweigh the public interest benefi ts of such communication.
