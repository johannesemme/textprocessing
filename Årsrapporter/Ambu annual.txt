letter to the shareholders 
the #1 single-use endoscopy company
ambu is emerging from the pandemic as a stronger 
company. during the past year, we achieved important 
milestones. we continued our accelerated growth and 
took decisive measures to fulfil our strategic aspiration to 
emerge as the #1 single-use endoscopy company. we 
strengthened our modular innovation engine, expanded 
our high-scale low-cost manufacturing setup, and 
continued to build dedicated commercial organisations 
focused on creating the single-use endoscopy market. 
 
as 
the 
pandemic 
continued, 
like 
other 
companies we faced challenges and disruption 
on an unprecedented scale – from lockdowns to 
freight congestion and inflated prices for 
logistics and raw materials. these challenges 
had a short-term impact on our sales and 
profitability, but we remained firm in our strategy 
to maximise our first-mover advantage and lead 
the way in the creation of the single-use market. 
 
transition from reusable to single-use continues to 
accelerate 
last year, the single-use endoscopy market continued to 
accelerate, as health systems and regulators increased 
their focus on infection control. the fda issued 
guidance that will drive single-use adoption across 
bronchoscopy and urological endoscopes, adding to the 
recommendations for duodenoscopy from 2020.  
 
published reports showed that cross-contamination 
cases in the usa rose eleven-fold in 2020 compared to 
2014, across gi (gastroenterology), bronchoscopy, and 
urology. in the case of single-use duodenoscopes, 
special reimbursement measures have been put in 
place, which will drive further adoption. the benefits and 
economics of transitioning from reusable to single-use 
endoscopy are becoming more and more compelling, 
and we see major group purchasing organisations 
creating dedicated single-use endoscopy categories. 
 
reaching more patients 
last year, more than 1.5 million patients were treated 
with an ambu single-use endoscope – a reach that is 
greater than for all other single-use endoscopy 
competitors combined. this represents a 41% increase 
by volume over prior year. the rapid growth has 
consolidated ambu’s position as the number one single-
use endoscopy player. 
 
we expanded our pulmonology offering with the launch 
of our integrated kit for bronchoscopy sampling and our 
camera-enhanced airway tube. these launches cement 
our position as the most versatile partner for single-use 
pulmonary endoscopy. we continued to see a rapid 
uptake of our expansion into new endoscopy segments 
– our rhinolaryngoscope in ent and our cystoscope in 
urology. we also upgraded our ascope duodeno, based 
on early user feedback, and implemented several 
technical advancements which – together with the 
european regulatory clearance – demonstrate ambu’s 
ability to support even the most complex endoscopy 
procedures with technologically advanced products, and 
rapidly iterate and fulfil customer needs. 
 
these achievements show how ambu is leading the 
creation of the single-use endoscopy market. they also 
show how customers value not only guaranteed sterility, 
but also availability and workflow benefits – eliminating 
service, repair and reprocessing costs – and also the 
health economic benefits of single-use endoscopy. 
 
our advances in healthcare must go hand in hand with 
our 
sustainability 
efforts. 
our 
sustainability 
achievements during the past year include augmenting 
our renewable electricity ratio and committing to aligning 
our carbon emission targets with the paris agreement’s 
1.5ºc climate goal. 
 
forever forward 
at ambu, our primary goal is to continue to lead the 
creation of the single-use endoscopy market. with the 
expansion of our modular r&d engine, this coming year 
we will introduce more than ten products across all major 
endoscopy segments – more than in the last four years 
combined, and also more than our main competitors 
combined. 
 
by the end of next year, we will have built the most 
comprehensive portfolio and ecosystem within single-
use endoscopy. our new plant in mexico will be 
operational as the world’s largest single-use endoscopy 
factory, expanding our manufacturing capacity at the 
pace required to support the growing demand and help 
us counter the current supply chain challenges. 
 
we believe there is a better way to perform endoscopy. 
we believe healthcare systems deserve a solution that 
is 100% sterile, and which provides convenience, 
flexibility and attractive economic benefits. we believe 
each patient deserves a new, sterile endoscope. we are 
proud to be helping to increase patient safety around the 
world, and we are proud to be recognised as the world’s 
most innovative single-use endoscopy company. 
 
most of all, we are proud of the entire ambu organisation, 
which continues to advance healthcare, forever forward.

business model 
 
 
 
 
ambu develops, manufactures and sells medical devices 
to hospitals, clinics and rescue services all over the world. 
single-use focus 
our devices are single-use, which means that they are only used during a single procedure 
for a specific patient. at the end of the procedure, they are discarded. the main advantages 
of single-use devices are that each patient is treated with a clean device – for improved 
patient safety – and that patient-ready devices are readily available. for advanced 
products, like endoscopes, the single-use concept means that healthcare professionals 
always have the latest technology at hand. 
we develop our products in close 
collaboration with healthcare 
professionals, in order to ensure 
that our solutions solve real-life 
clinical challenges in the best 
possible way. 
 
our product development 
organisation is global and focused 
on rapid high-tech innovation 
in a modular organisation, 
leveraging advances in consumer 
electronics. our main innovation 
centres are in denmark, germany 
and malaysia, where we focus our 
efforts on developing new products. 
in addition, we have local 
development departments at our 
factories in china and the usa. 
 
during the past two years, we have 
increased our global r&d 
organisation by 163%, and our 
engineers cover fields such as 
mechanics, electronics, optics, 
software, artificial intelligence, 
usability, and clinical research & 
biosafety. we rely on an 
organisation of around 400 
in-house engineers and a 
number of exclusive consultants 
and technology companies. 
we own and operate 
factories in malaysia 
(penang), china 
(xiamen) and the 
usa (indiana). our 
expertise and continuous 
optimisation efforts have 
resulted in an ability to 
maintain a high output of 
quality single-use devices 
at low cost. 
 
to secure our production 
capacity of single-use 
endoscopes beyond 
2022/23, and to 
manage our risk 
exposure, we are 
establishing a new 
manufacturing site 
in mexico. the site will 
become operational in 
2021/22.  
most of our revenue is 
generated through our own 
direct sales force, 
which has experience with 
single-use devices and is 
specialised within 
visualization, anaesthesia 
and patient monitoring & 
diagnostics. ambu has 
direct sales in 20 countries 
and sales via distributors on 
other markets. 
 
selling single-use 
endoscopes involves several 
stakeholders, from clinical 
users to group purchasing 
organisations. in order to 
drive the conversion 
of hospitals from 
reusable to single-use, 
we have built a 
sophisticated commercial 
organisation with corporate 
accounts, healthcare 
economists, sales 
representatives, marketing 
experts and clinical trainers.

strategy 
ambu is a company with 84 years of heritage. the 
current chapter in the company’s story, however, is 
dominated by the decision in the late 2000s to develop 
the world’s first single-use flexible bronchoscope. 
 
during the past 12 years, ambu has spearheaded the 
establishment of single-use endoscopy as a clinical 
practice and as a business. in recent years, we have 
expanded from pulmonology into other areas of 
endoscopy, which will ultimately expand the combined 
market potential 30 times: these are ent (ear, nose and 
throat), urology and gi (gastroenterology). we are on a 
journey with extraordinary potential. 
 
this part of our business – which we call visualization –
has grown rapidly and now represents more than half of 
our overall business, and we also have a comprehensive 
pipeline of single-use endoscopes to be launched in the 
coming years. most of our investments in innovation and 
sales & marketing are aimed at maximising the value 
from this part of our business. 
 
we estimate that the single-use endoscopy market has 
a total value of usd 0.5 billion in 2021 and will reach 
usd 2.5 billion by 2025. and we aim to continue to be 
the market leader. 
 
the growth potential in the business areas of 
anaesthesia and pmd is less radical, but our strong 
position in these segments justifies the allocation of 
dedicated resources for further product development and 
commercial focus on these parts of our business. 
 
investing in visualization 
during 2020/21, we continued the strategy of investing 
aggressively in innovation in order to maintain and 
cement our long-term position. during the past three 
years, we have expanded our investments in innovation 
activities by 149%, from dkk 226m to dkk 562m. 
during these years, we have also expanded our 
commercial infrastructure to maximise our first-mover 
advantage. 
 
 
focus on highest-potential 
segments and geographies 
 
we focus on a successful entry into gi and 
urology, while strengthening our position in 
pulmonology. we will increase our growth in 
anaesthesia and pmd by focusing on circuits, 
laryngeal masks and neurophysiology. 
 
north america, western europe and japan are 
our primary markets. 
the four pillars of our strategy 
invest to build best-in-class 
commercial organisation 
 
we are building a 100% direct endoscopy sales 
force in our key markets, with focus on hospitals. 
in addition, we are strengthening our sales 
support activities to increase digital marketing, 
healthcare economics and clinical affairs. 
 
ambu’s global scaling-up entails a focus on 
upgrading 
it, 
business 
processes 
and 
cybersecurity. 
scale innovation and 
manufacturing engines 
 
we are expanding our research and development 
and our regulatory infrastructure to increase the 
speed at which we can bring new innovations to 
market. 
 
our high-scale, low-cost manufacturing is the 
backbone of our ability to supply healthcare workers 
with affordable quality devices. we are scaling up 
with the establishment of a new manufacturing plant. 
grow sustainably, for our 
people and our planet 
 
we have set environmental, social and governance 
goals on which we will deliver through commitment 
at both strategic and operational levels. 
 
we are building and sustaining a healthy culture 
based on our company values of results with speed, 
collaboration and integrity. 
11 
 
drivers of single-use endoscopy 
the market for endoscopy is changing, and we believe 
that five key factors will drive the shift from reusable 
towards single-use endoscopy. 
 
the risk of contamination will continue to be a driver of 
single-use endoscopy within all markets. based on 
concerns raised by authorities, there are significant 
opportunities from eliminating the operational challenges 
associated with the sterilisation and reprocessing of 
reusable scopes. the covid-19 pandemic has raised 
awareness of contamination issues significantly, and we 
expect a heightened sense of urgency going forward. 
 
convenience and availability are challenges that can 
be resolved with single-use scopes. always having the 
latest technology available and not having to wait for the 
scope to be cleaned, but rather making sure that 
hospitals can perform an endoscopy when the clinical 
need is there, will further drive the shift to single-use. 
 
healthcare economics are under pressure, and 
reusable scopes are costly to reprocess and repair, while 
also being prone to wear and tear. studies show that 
single-use scopes are often financially advantageous 
compared to reusable scopes and can reduce healthcare 
sector costs. 
 
technology is advancing rapidly, and technical 
progress in such areas as sensors, image enhancement 
software and monitor processing power means that the 
image resolution and clinical performance of single-use 
endoscopy products are improving over time, relative to 
reusables. 
 
regulators are supporting the creation of the single-use 
endoscopy market to deal with cross-contamination 
risks. the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) has 
issued safety communications across key endoscopy 
areas highlighting potential problems with reusable 
endoscopes. 
 
each of these drivers is becoming stronger every year 
and, in combination, make the shift from reusable to 
single-use a reality. the drivers represent substantial 
growth opportunities for a future market within single-use 
endoscopy. as we improve the technology and invest in 
innovation, we believe that ambu can be a significant 
single-use player in all endoscopy markets. 
ambu’s key advantages 
first-mover advantage, since ambu has been working 
in the single-use market for over ten years. this gives us 
a significant understanding of what it takes to develop 
and commercialise single-use endoscopes. 
 
modular r&d engine and rich pipeline, whereby 
innovation teams work across a wide group of 
technological areas. with our modular organisation we 
increase our speed of innovation, as technologies and 
upgrades can be deployed across several parallel 
products in development. 
 
offering a broad range of products is an integrated 
part of our strategy. as the range of our product offering 
grows and we enter more clinical areas, there are 
positive effects when we go to a healthcare system and 
can present offerings across all areas of flexible 
endoscopy. 
 
a high-scale, low-cost manufacturing setup based on 
decades of know-how in lean and intelligent production 
that enables us to supply quality products at price points 
that can drive conversion, and thereby accelerate the 
transition from reusable to single-use. 
 
a dedicated sales force trained in our value proposition 
and our customers’ complex workflows can drive the 
conversion effectively. effectiveness, combined with 
continuous and increasing product launches, creates a 
significant opportunity for value and operational scale. 
pipeline overview 
single-use pure player 
ambu develops products with a focus on becoming a 
single-use pure player within all main endoscopy areas. 
we are broadening our range within each area so as to 
offer the most comprehensive portfolio and an 
ecosystem with cross-platform integrations. 
 
display and processor unit technology 
one of the main drivers of single-use endoscopy is the 
quality of the image on the display unit. ambu has 
developed portable monitors with advanced full hd 
imaging for enhanced image quality, and with more 
processing power and improved functionality. in addition, 
substantial resources are being invested in the 
development of software, including image enhancement 
software, to assist users and improve patient outcomes. 
 
pulmonology 
pulmonology was the first market we entered in 2009 
and represents 3 million annual endoscopy procedures. 
the latest generation of our single-use bronchoscope – 
ascope™ 4 broncho – is the cornerstone of our 
visualization business. during 2020/21, we expanded 
our footprint in pulmonology by launching two new 
devices – vivasight 2 dlt and ascope™ 4 broncho 
sampler set – in the most comprehensive range of 
single-use pulmonology devices on the market. in 
2021/22, we are launching the fifth generation of our 
bronchoscope, which will give us the opportunity to 
penetrate the bronchoscopy suite market, which 
represents an incremental 2 million procedures. in 
addition, we are developing tailor-made versions of our 
bronchoscope for selected markets and procedures, as 
well as a video laryngoscope that is integrated with the 
aview™ monitor platform. 
 
ent (ear, nose and throat)  
with its 11 million nose and throat procedures, the ent 
endoscopy market represents significant opportunities. 
ambu launched ascope™ 4 rhinolaryngo in 2018/19, 
and this product has contributed significantly to the 
overall growth in 2020/21. we are developing a new 
version for expanded clinical application, as well as high-
resolution scopes for ent that will be launched over the 
next two years. 
 
 
 
12 
 
urology 
urology represents another important market for ambu, 
with a total of 8 million procedures. our ascope™ 4 
cysto was cleared for sale in the usa in april 2020, and 
in japan and europe in q1 2020/21. the ascope™ 4 
cysto has been received very well on all markets and in 
its first year of launch already made a significant 
contribution to the overall growth. in 2021/22, we will 
launch an hd version. our cystoscope targets bladder 
and urethra procedures, which account for 6 million out 
of a total of 8 million annual urology procedures. to 
complete our urology portfolio, again in 2021/22, we will 
introduce a ureteroscope to target kidney procedures, 
which account for 2 million procedures a year. the 
combination of a single-use cystoscope and an 
ureteroscope is ideal, since in many cases physicians 
use both on the same patient. 
 
gastroenterology (gi) 
the single-use duodenoscope – ascope™ duodeno –
was launched in the usa in 2019/20 and achieved 
european regulatory clearance in q4 2020/21. based 
customer feedback, we implemented several technology 
upgrades and, going into 2021/22, the commercial 
launch of ascope™ duodeno is one of our key priorities. 
ambu’s entry into the gi market represents a major 
opportunity, with a total of 72 million procedures split 
across colonoscopy (50 million), gastroscopy (20 million) 
and duodenoscopy (2 million). gi is a very important 
market to which we will bring a gastroscope and a 
colonoscope during 2021/22, as well as the second 
generation of our duodenoscope. ambu will thereby be 
able to commercialise a broad range of gi scopes that 
share the same advanced technology and abox modular 
system.

outlook for 2021/22
in 2020/21, ambu was able to continue to grow rapidly 
despite the challenging environment with continued 
impact from the pandemic disturbing the activity levels at 
hospitals paired with headwind from disruptions in the 
global supply chain and raw material inflation starting to 
show effects. as we move into 2021/22, we expect the 
market to continue to normalise, while supply chain 
disruption and the increased cost levels from raw 
materials and energy inflation will continue to show 
impact. 
 
with higher awareness of the contamination challenges 
from reusable endoscopy and a steady flow of evidence 
showing the benefits for hospitals of converting to single-
use, the prospects for the accelerated emergence of the 
single-use market looks promising. 
 
with ambu’s product portfolio and rich pipeline, we are 
well-positioned to continue leading the creation of the 
single-use endoscopy market. 
 
in the following, we will describe the detailed 
assumptions on which we build our view of the expected 
financial performance for 2021/22. 
 
market conditions 
we expect the single-use endoscopy market to continue 
to grow at a rapid pace driven by awareness and focus 
on infection control among medical authorities, but also 
by the strong appeal to hospitals of the good clinical 
performance, economics, and opportunities for workflow 
efficiencies which our single-use solutions offer.  
 
we continue to monitor the development of the covid-
19 
pandemic 
with 
respect 
to 
intensive 
care 
bronchoscopy, elective procedure activity and hospital 
productivity. subject to hospital planning and the 
willingness of patients to enter hospitals, we expect the 
demand to further improve throughout the year and to 
fully return to pre-covid levels in the second half of 
2021/22. 
 
the covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the global 
supply chain, and for ambu this has led to higher lead-
times and higher costs of running our supply chain. this 
situation has caused a need for higher output of products 
from our factories and thereby increased our inventory 
levels. in addition, comes cost of raw materials and 
energy. we consider the main part of these disruptions 
to be temporary but to remain throughout most of, if not 
the full, financial year 2021/22. for 2021/22, we will thus 
expect the cost of running our supply chain to remain at 
a high level and we expect an increasing impact from raw 
material inflation as fixed-price contracts will start to 
expire, and mitigations applied in 2020/21 are 
exhausted. 
 
specifically, on freight costs we have in 2020/21 spent 
dkk 70m more than initially planned, including dkk 50m 
on airfreight, to adjust inventories to the increased lead-
times. going into 2021/22, we expect freight costs to 
remain at a high level. 
 
applied assumptions 
the expected financial performance for 2021/22 
assumes the following important external factors: 
• 
a continued recovery from the covid-19 pandemic 
in our key markets with elective procedures 
returning to pre-covid levels in the second half of 
2021/22. 
• 
a gradual recovery of the global freight market and 
of cost index of raw materials in 2022/23. 
financial guidance 2021/22 
on this basis, we have set the financial targets for 
2021/22 as follows: 
 
 
organic growth    15-19%  
 
the organic growth will be driven by visualization’s most 
recent product launches, while anaesthesia and pmd 
are expected to be positively impacted by a gradually 
normalising demand. 
 
as we move through 2021/22, the organic growth will be 
back-end loaded as we gain momentum from product 
launches. in addition, organic revenue for q1 2021/22 is 
expected to be flat over q1 2020/21, as we face a high 
comparable driven by last year’s nhs safety stock 
orders. 
 
we expect the average selling prices across our single-
use endoscopy portfolio to remain stable within product 
categories and geographies. 
 
 
 
ebit margin    7-9%  
 
in 2021/22, we will invest in commercial resources and 
manufacturing capacity – our new plant in mexico – to 
support our product launches. 
 
furthermore, we expect a negative impact from raw 
material inflation and continued high supply chain costs. 
for q1 2021/22, our ebit margin is expected to be low 
single digit and gradually improve as we build financial 
scale. 
 
 
 
organic growth is expected to be 15-19% and will be 
driven by visualization, which will continue to deliver high 
double-digit growth rates. our recent launches, i.e. 
ascope™ rhinolaryngo, ascope™ 4 cysto and 
ascope™ duodeno, are expected to contribute a large 
share of the organic growth as we create the markets 
and move through the year. the contribution to growth 
from products that will be launched in 2021/22 is 
expected to be modest during this first year of launch but 
will be important growth drivers going forward. 
 
15 
 
the anaesthesia and pmd business have in 2020/21 
been negatively impacted by a slower than expected 
return of elective procedures. both businesses are in 
2021/22 expected to gradually improve as the external 
market conditions return to pre-covid levels. 
 
the phasing of the quarterly growth in 2021/22 will be 
back-end loaded as the recently launched products are 
expected to gain traction and elective procedures reach 
full recovery. furthermore, the organic growth in q1 
2021/22 is expected to be close to 0% due to covid-19 
driven orders to the nhs in england in q1 2020/21. 
 
we expect the average selling prices across our single-
use endoscopy portfolio to remain stable and with 
minimum price evolution within product categories and 
geographies. 
 
we expect the gross margin for 2021/22 to be slightly 
below 2020/21. the gross margin will be impacted by 
two opposite factors: 1) the high double-digit growth 
rates in visualization that will increase the gross margin 
while 2) inflation from raw materials and additional 
overhead costs related to the ramp-up of the 
manufacturing facility in mexico.  
 
ebit margin is expected to be 7-9% and will be 
impacted by the high costs of running the supply chain 
as well as the raw material inflation with some expected 
improvements late in the year. as we move into 2021/22, 
we 
have 
built 
a 
comprehensive 
commercial 
infrastructure that will ensure our ability to effectively 
launch and create the markets. the opex ratio to 
revenue will be highest in the early part of the year and 
improve together with the ebit margin as we move 
through the year, meaning that the ebit-margin for h1 
2021/22 is expected to be low single digit.  
 
free cash flow is expected to be negative and will be 
impacted by the profit levels and continued capex 
investments into innovation, manufacturing including 
mexico and it infrastructure. the majority of capex will 
be related to innovation and to enable manufacturing to 
start up production lines of new devices in line with the 
planned product launches. 
 
the perimeter of the manufacturing site in mexico is 
based on a financial lease with a value of approx. dkk 
225m which ambu will take ownership of in q1 2021/22. 
capex relating to the interiors of the manufacturing site 
is expected at approx. dkk 70m. we expect the site in 
mexico to be operational in the second half of 2021/22. 
 
the nibd/ebitda ratio is expected to increase in the 
first half of 2021/22 and then decrease towards the end 
of the financial year. our loan documentation is designed 
to support the expected evolution of the nibd/ebitda 
ratio. 
 
currency expectations 
the financial outlook for 2021/22 is based on the 
following exchange-rate assumptions:

approx. 55% of ambu’s total revenue is invoiced in usd. 
in addition, approx. 32% of revenue is invoiced in eur 
or dkk, and approx. 7% in gbp, while the remaining 6% 
is invoiced in other currencies. production and capacity 
costs are predominantly settled in usd, dkk, eur, 
myr and cny.

forward-looking statements 
 
forward-looking statements, in particular relating to future sales, operating income and other key financials, are subject to risks and 
uncertainties. various factors, many of which lie outside ambu’s control, may cause the realised results to differ materially from the 
expectations presented in this report. such factors include, but are not confined to, changes in market conditions and the competitive 
situation, changes in demand and purchasing patterns, fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates, and general economic, 
political and commercial conditions. see also the section concerning risks on page 31.

business performance – regions 
comparative figures for 2019/20 are stated in brackets. 
 
ambu has organised its sales in three regions: 
• 
north america 
• 
europe 
• 
rest of world 
 
 
full-year revenue totalled dkk 4,013m (dkk 3,567m), 
corresponding to organic growth of 16% (26%) and 
reported growth of 13% (26%). 
 
the year was characterised by global uncertainty since 
disruptive factors – such as the emergence of new 
covid-19 variants and supply chain bottlenecks – 
impacted societies and economies, while potentially 
stabilising factors – of which the most crucial was the roll-
out of vaccines – pointed towards post-pandemic 
normality. 
 
despite the global volatility, all of ambu’s commercial 
regions grew by double-digit figures, but with significant 
quarterly fluctuations in the growth rates. 
 
for ambu, 2020/21 was a year of continued high 
demand for single-use endoscopes with significant 
geographical variations and fluctuating demand for our 
anaesthesia and patient monitoring & diagnostics 
portfolios. these variations and fluctuations matched the 
pace at which elective hospital activity gradually began 
to recover. the return to normal hospital activity was on 
its way as we entered 2020/21, but in parts of the world 
was slowed down by surges in covid-19 infections, 
national lockdowns and supply chain disruptions leading 
to a backlog of orders, especially within the anaesthesia 
product range, as we exit 2020/21. 
 
north america accounted for 43% of revenue in 
2020/21, compared to 45% last year, based on organic 
growth of 17% (25%) and reported growth of 9% (26%). 
the difference of eight percentage points between 
organic and reported growth is due to the depreciating 
usd/dkk exchange rate during the past year. 
 
we saw steady revenue growth during the year, driven 
by strong sales of visualization products with 33% 
growth, a moderate uptake of 2% growth in anaesthesia 
sales – comprising high demand for resuscitators, but 
lower demand for most other products in the anaesthesia 
portfolio – and a marked improvement of 10% growth in 
patient monitoring & diagnostics sales after the decline 
in sales during 2019/20. 
 
elective procedures remained below normal levels with 
significant variation across states and with quarters in 
which hospitals were scaling back on elective activities, 
due to the impact of the covid delta variant.

during the year, we expanded our contracts with the 
major group purchasing organisations (gpos) in the 
usa securing access to our existing portfolio and coming 
pipeline. with these expansions, ambu is on contract 
with all four major gpos, with either a full or partial 
portfolio of single-use endoscopy categories available for 
the customers that are served by the gpos. 
 
as of october 2021, the cms (the u.s. centers for 
medicare & medicaid services) has implemented 
reimbursement for inpatient single-use duodenoscopy. 
in addition to the outpatient reimbursement that was 
previously approved, this development makes it more 
economically advantageous for many north american 
healthcare centres to use single-use duodenoscopes, 
since part of the device cost is covered by medicare. 
 
europe accounted for 45% of revenue in 2020/21, 
compared to 43% last year, based on organic and 
reported growth of 15% (32%). 
 
despite the depressed elective procedure activity and 
supply chain constraints, europe achieved double-digit 
growth driven by the strong visualization growth across 
all key markets, especially in the uk, italy and spain. 
 
visualization sales showed organic growth of 26% for the 
year, peaking in q1 by almost tripling sales compared to 
q1 of the prior year, partly due to an extraordinary order 
from the nhs (united kingdom national health service). 
the consensus view in european healthcare in favour of 
switching to single-use endoscopes to reduce infection 
rates continued to benefit sales. anaesthesia sales 
declined organically by 9% in europe, due to lower 
elective activity and shipment delays towards the end of 
the year. the same negative effects held back our pmd 
sales, although shipment delays were less of a limiting 
factor for the pmd business, and organic growth 
amounted to 8% for the year following declining sales in 
the prior year. 
 
rest of world – which comprises asia-pacific, the 
middle east and latin america – accounted for 12% of 
revenue in 2020/21, with japan emerging as the single 
largest market in rest of world. organic growth was 18% 
(13%), and reported growth was 15% (12%). 
 
the organic visualization growth in rest of world was 
47% for the year, driven by sales in australia and japan. 
the market dynamics in rest of world were similar to 
europe with regard to the anaesthesia and pmd 
business areas and resulted in a decline in sales of -5% 
in anaesthesia and an increase in sales of 6% in pmd.

the visualization business consists of flexible single-use 
endoscopes connected to multi-use display and 
processor units, for procedures inside the human body 
through natural openings. 
 
in 2020/21, total visualization revenue grew organically 
by 31% (81%), and reported growth ended at 27% 
(82%). visualization thus accounts for 54% (48%) of the 
total revenue for the year. 
 
the largest contributor to our visualization revenue 
continues to be sales of single-use endoscopes for 
pulmonology; and our bronchoscopes in particular have 
played a significant role in the treatment of covid-19 
patients. however, single-use rhinolaryngoscopes (ent) 
and cystoscopes (urology) also show rapid growth and 
contribute a sizeable and increasing share of revenue. 
 
in europe, national guidelines explicitly recommend the 
use of single-use scopes for covid-19 patients, to limit 
the risk of cross-contamination. in the usa, the 
approach from the association of pulmonologists is to 
avoid bronchoscopy of suspected covid-19 patients, if 
possible, to protect the hospital staff from aerosols. with 
the increasing vaccination rates, however, we have seen 
that treatment procedures in the usa and europe are 
becoming more aligned. 
 
on 1 april 2021, the us food and drug administration 
(fda) announced an investigation into the potential 
causes and contributing factors associated with reported 
infections 
and 
contamination 
issues 
caused 
by 
endoscopic urology procedures. on 25 june 2021, the 
fda updated a safety communication recommending 
that healthcare providers consider using single-use 
bronchoscopes in situations where there is increased 
risk of spreading infection, or where no support for 
immediate reprocessing is available. in addition, the fda 
now recommends that healthcare facilities consider 
using sterilisation for reprocessing instead of high-level 
disinfection, which is the less costly approach that is 
currently used. 
 
more clinical data is also being published on the topic of 
single-use endoscopy. recently, in october 2021, a us 
study of more than 14,000 patients’ data concluded that 
single-use 
bronchoscopes 
can 
reduce 
hospital 
readmission rates by 53%.

all in all, there is a growing body of evidence and 
regulatory guidance to show that hospitals should 
consider the transition to single-use endoscopy as the 
standard of care, given the clinical, financial and 
operational benefits. 
 
for 2020/21, organic growth in visualization in north 
america was 33% (71%), and in europe 26% (96%), 
while rest of world contributed organic growth of 47% 
(55%). 
 
at the beginning of the year, expected volume sales of 
single-use endoscopes were in the range of 1.3-1.4 
million units. however, on 1 july, we adjusted upwards 
to +1.4 million units. the final volume sold was 1,528,000 
(1,085,000), which is equivalent to an increase of 41% 
compared to last year. 
 
during the past year, we expanded our product portfolio 
within pulmonology with two product launches – 
vivasight 2 dlt and ascope™ 4 broncho sampler set 
– and we implemented continuous enhancements to our 
duodenoscope and also secured its european market 
clearance, 
to 
strengthen 
our 
entrance 
into 
gastroenterology. 
 
ascope™ duodeno is ambu’s first device in the field of 
gastroenterology and addresses the need for a 100% 
sterile duodenoscope designed to eliminate the risk of 
patient cross-contamination and to enhance patient 
safety. the ascope™ duodeno solution, which consists 
of a single-use endoscope and a reusable processor 
unit, achieved fda clearance in july 2020 and gained 
ce mark on 18 august 2021.  
 
 
 
 
number of endoscopes sold, ‘000 units 
during 2020/21, we conducted a controlled market 
release in the usa and used the customer input to 
develop 
product 
enhancements 
that 
are 
fully 
implemented in the ascope™ duodeno as at year-end.  
 
at the time of publishing the annual report, the first 29 
cases are completed in the us clinical trial. the initial 
data shows a procedure success rate of 100%, meaning 
that all cases were successfully completed using 
ascope™ duodeno, with no cases converted to a 
reusable duodenoscope. the cases included all 
complexity grades for endoscopic procedures – from 1 
(easiest) to 4 (most difficult) as determined by the 
american society for gastrointestinal endoscopy. the 
ascope™ duodeno is now commercially available in the 
usa, europe and australia. 
 
to increase our endoscope manufacturing capacity, we 
decided back in 2019/20 to initiate construction of a 
second endoscopy plant in juarez, mexico. in march 
2021, we broke ground, and on 1 july 2021, we 
announced the acceleration of construction, effectively 
moving the target date for the plant to become 
operational from 2022/23 to 2021/22. the additional 
plant will expand our manufacturing capacity and also 
improve our global supply chain setup.

the anaesthesia business consists of devices used for 
airway management in hospitals and ambulances 
typically for procedures that require general anaesthesia 
or for first aid. 
 
the covid-19 pandemic increased the demand for 
resuscitators and reduced the demand for devices used 
for elective hospital procedures. during 2020/21, the 
level of elective hospital activity increased gradually, 
however, with regional fluctuations and below pre-
covid activity levels. in addition, our anaesthesia sales 
were impacted by shipment delays caused by the 
congestion of the global container freight market, and to 
ensure delivery of mainly anaesthesia products we used 
extraordinary volume of airfreight to move products to 
customers in europe and north america. despite these 
efforts we finished the year with a backlog of orders for 
anaesthesia products that we expect to ship in the first 
half of 2021/22. 
 
within anaesthesia, revenue declined organically in 
2020/21 by -2% (7%), and reported growth fell by -6% 
(7%). all in all, anaesthesia accounted for 25% (30%) of 
ambu’s revenue in 2020/21. 
 
organic growth in north america was 2% (8%), while 
sales in europe declined by -9% (6%) and in rest of 
world by -5% (4%).

the pmd business consists of devices for cardiology 
and neurophysiology – typically electrodes for the 
measurement of body signals – as well as products for 
first aid and the training of first aid skills. 
 
our pmd business caters almost exclusively for elective 
procedures and was therefore purely negatively 
impacted by the outbreak of covid-19 in 2019/20. 
during the past year, some of the elective business has 
returned, but at a slower pace than we predicted going 
into 2020/21. this means that the pmd market is not 
back to pre-covid activity levels yet. 
 
in 2020/21, pmd accounted for 21% (22%) of ambu’s 
revenue, and organic growth in pmd was 9% (-10%) 
while reported growth was 7% (-10%). 
 
organic growth in north america was 10% (-8%), in 
europe 8% (-10%) and in rest of world 6% (-15%).

revenue for the year was dkk 4,013m, up dkk 446m 
from last year, corresponding to organic growth of 16% 
and a reported revenue growth of 13% (26% organic and 
reported growth was posted last year). 
 
the combined effect of changes in end-customer prices 
in 2020/21 was in line with expectations and corresponds 
to -0.6 percentage points across all business areas. 
 
gross profit was up 13% at dkk 2,503m (dkk 
2,212m), while gross margin increased by 0.4 
percentage points to 62.4% (62.0%).  
 
this year’s gross profit was impacted positively by a 
better product mix due to the volume growth in 
visualization. in addition, manufacturing has contributed 
to the improved scale with more output at almost 
unchanged levels of indirect production costs compared 
to last year offset by write-down of inventories of dkk 
13m (dkk 6m).   
 
in 2020/21, approx. 49% of ambu’s total revenue was 
exposed to changes in the usd/dkk exchange rate. in 
addition, 36% of revenue was invoiced in eur or dkk, 
and just below 10% in gbp, while the remaining 5% was 
invoiced in other currencies. production and capacity 
costs were predominantly settled in usd, dkk, eur, 
myr and cny.   
 
in 2020/21, the average usd/dkk exchange rate was 
622 (667), down 7%. the average cny/dkk exchange 
rate appreciated slightly, and the myr/dkk exchange 
rate depreciated by 5%, while gbp/dkk was almost 
unchanged.  
 
the combined effect of exchange rate fluctuations on 
this year’s revenue is a negative impact of 3%, while the 
net impact on earnings and ebit margin is limited, due 
to the usd cost base, including factories in china and 
malaysia, where approx. 63% of the direct manufacturing 
costs are settled in usd. 
 
capacity costs totalled dkk 2,163m (dkk 1,784m), 
corresponding to a 21% absolute increase of dkk 379m. 
the rate of cost was 54% (50%). 
 
total capacity costs and rate of cost, % 
 
 
selling and distribution costs were up dkk 240m or 
20% at dkk 1,468m due to the full-year effect of 
expanding the commercial infrastructure during fy 
2019/20 across regions, as well as higher freight rates 
and the year-on-year difference in bad debt provisions. 
 
the full-year effect stems from the increase in the overall 
size of the commercial organisation.  
 
in 2020/21, total selling and distribution staff costs 
increased by 29% (81%) or dkk 207m (dkk 316m) to 
dkk 915m (dkk 708m). the strategic rationale for 
expanding our commercial infrastructure was to support 
our urology launch and prepare for the entrance into gi. 
 
during 2020/21, our operation has been disturbed by the 
congestion of the global supply chain which has led to 
delays in deliveries and increase in costs. to meet the 
demands of our customers, we have in 2020/21 spent 
dkk 75m more on freight than planned. this includes 
dkk 50m on airfreight. the extra freight costs equal 
1.9% of revenue and have accelerated during the 
second half of the financial year.    
 
last year, management saw a higher risk of credit losses 
on trade receivables, following the impact of covid-19 
on healthcare systems. against this background, an 
additional accrual of dkk 31m was allocated. during 
2020/21, the risk was deemed to have subsided, and to 
this date no significant losses are realised. the covid-
19 accrual was partly reversed in q2, and income of dkk 
15m was taken to opex. 
 
the year-on-year effect of the covid-19 provision for 
bad debtors is therefore a reduction in costs of dkk 46m.   
 
development costs increased by 43% to dkk 225m, 
driven by expansion of our visualization pipeline. the 
cost effect on ebitda is an increase of dkk 50m, 
stemming from activities related to the eu medical 
device regulation, clinical affairs, and overheads in our 
three major innovation centres including staff costs.

development costs are capitalised in so far as this 
concerns the direct resources associated with approved 
innovation projects. the increase in amortisation in 
2020/21 is due to the increased amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets.  
 
management and administration expenses were up 
18% or dkk 71m at dkk 470m, including an increase in 
staff costs of dkk 57m to dkk 252m (dkk 195m), as 
additional 
talent 
within 
enabling 
functions 
was 
onboarded.  
 
operating profit (ebit) was dkk 340m (dkk 428m), 
with an ebit margin of 8.5% (12.0%). the impact from 
foreign exchange rates on absolute earnings and ebit 
margin were negligible. 
 
ebit before special items – dkkm 
 
depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses 
were up dkk 35m to an expense of dkk 216m (dkk 
181m). the increase is driven by right-of-use-assets and 
tangible assets with a combined effect of dkk 30m, as 
well as the full-year effect of amortisation of acquired 
technologies in the field of duodenoscopy of dkk 16m. 
on the other hand, impairment losses and amortisation 
decreased from last year by dkk 11m. 
 
ebitda was dkk 556m (dkk 609m), with an ebitda 
margin of 13.9% (17.1%). 
 
net financials amounted to a net expense of dkk 32m 
(dkk 106m). 
 
the result of financials is explained as follows: 
• 
interest income, others dkk 3m (dkk 0m). 
• 
foreign exchanges gave a net income of dkk 4m 
(net expense of dkk 30m).  
• 
fair value adjustment of derivative instruments 
comprised income of dkk 1m (dkk 3m).  
• 
interest expenses on bank and leases totalled dkk 
24m (dkk 28m). 
• 
the interest element from liabilities stated at present 
amortised value and other interest expenses was a 
net expense of dkk 6m (dkk 3m).  
• 
fair value adjustments of contingent consideration 
relating to the acquisition of invendo medical gmbh 
represent a net expense of dkk 10m (dkk 48m).  
tax on profit for the year totalled an expense of dkk 
61m (dkk 81m), corresponding to an average effective 
tax rate on profit (etr) of 20% (25%), which is below the 
etr initially expected going into the year.  
 
the reduced etr is a consequence of the danish 
government’s temporary increase in tax deductions for 
r&d costs, which can partly be applied to ambu’s 
development costs and capital expenditure. this 
substantial increase was activated during 2020/21, with 
effect from 2019/20 until the end of 2021/22.  
 
net profit was dkk 247m (dkk 241m).   
 
diluted earnings per share (eps-d) were dkk 0.98 
(dkk 0.97) for the financial year.

total assets were dkk 5,740m (dkk 4,926m), and 
invested capital was dkk 4,711m, up dkk 993m from 
last year with a 6% (9%) return on invested capital based 
on ebit less tax.  
 
non-current assets were dkk 4,132m, up dkk 443m 
from last year, driven by an increase in the carrying 
amount for development projects of dkk 344m (dkk 
233m) as well as tangible assets of dkk 182m (dkk 
143m). 
 
net working capital was dkk 789m (dkk 581m) by the 
end of 2020/21, corresponding to an increase of dkk 
208m. net working capital relative to revenue was 20% 
(16%), driven by higher inventories.

inventories were dkk 748m (dkk 515m) at the end of 
the year, corresponding to 19% (14%) of revenue. in 
absolute values, inventories have increased by dkk 
233m (dkk 9m) or 45%. this increase concerns an 
increase in safety stocks of raw materials at our factories 
and the effect of a constrained container market, with 
longer lead times, giving a combined effect of approx. 
dkk 169m. 
 
trade receivables totalled dkk 699m (dkk 521m), 
corresponding to 17% (15%) of revenue. calculated at 
fixed exchange rates, the average number of credit days 
was 62 (54).  
 
last year, the credit risk associated with trade 
receivables 
was 
adversely 
affected 
by 
the 
consequences of covid-19. by the end of september 
2021, the risk is deemed to have contracted, so that the 
provision for bad debts is reduced to dkk 21m (dkk 
38m). 
 
trade and other payables totalled dkk 742m (dkk 
547m), corresponding to 18% (15%) of revenue. the 
increase from last year is driven by higher levels of 
procurement and the construction of the factory in 
mexico. 
 
net interest-bearing debt and gearing 
cash and cash equivalents amounted to dkk 64m (dkk 
98m), and net interest-bearing debt (nibd) totaled dkk 
759m (dkk 1,346m), corresponding to 1.4 (2.2) of 
ebitda.  
 
during 2020/21 nibd was reduced by dkk 587m. the 
reduction is driven by the 1.86% capital increase and 
sale of treasury shares made in january 2021, with total 
proceeds of dkk 1,281m, offset by negative free cash 
flow of dkk -245m, additional leasing commitments by 
dkk 117m, payment of contingent consideration by dkk 
398m and distribution of dividend to shareholders by 
dkk 73m. 
 
new financing agreement with primary banks 
in accordance with the group’s treasury policy, ambu 
signed in june 2021 a new credit facility agreement with 
the company’s primary banks.  
 
total credit facilities available are now dkk 1,500m 
(dkk 2,300m) and the cost of financing includes 
sustainability targets as part of our esg strategy. 
 
at the end of september 2021, ambu had unutilised 
capital resources from cash, overdraft and credit facilities 
of approx. dkk 1.0bn (dkk 1.2bn).

contingent consideration was dkk 137m at the end of 
the year, which is a decrease of dkk 289m from last year 
due to the eur 40m (equivalent to dkk 298m) payment 
in october 2020 following the fda clearance of the 
duodenoscope, as well as the cost of unwinded cash 
flows of dkk 10m (dkk 48m) taken to financial 
expenses.  
 
other liabilities were dkk 86m, corresponding to a 
decrease over the past year of dkk 51m, primarily 
stemming from a reduction in deferred tax liabilities.  
equity 
at the end of september 2021, equity totalled dkk 
3,952m (dkk 2,372m), corresponding to an equity ratio 
of 69% (48%) of total assets.   
 
other comprehensive income 
other comprehensive income includes a net income of 
dkk 33m (net expense of dkk 81m) from foreign 
currency translation adjustments of foreign subsidiaries 
due to the appreciation of the usd/dkk exchange rate 
by 1% (depreciation by 7% last year) since the end of the 
previous financial year. 
 
other equity 
at the annual general meeting held on 9 december 
2020, it was decided to pay dividend of dkk 73m. since 
the annual general meeting, the proposed dividend of 
dkk 73m has been distributed in full, including dkk 1m 
for ambu’s portfolio of treasury shares.  
 
on 27 january 2021, ambu announced it was seeking to 
strengthen its capital base by issuing new shares and 
through the sale of treasury shares. an accelerated 
book-building process was concluded on the following 
days, and a total of 4,711,832 new class b shares and 
250,000 treasury shares were sold at a price of dkk 262 
per share. total capital of dkk 1,300m was raised. less 
transaction costs of dkk 19m, this is equivalent to net 
proceeds of dkk 1,281m in the form of a capital 
contribution of dkk 1,216m and dkk 65m from the sale 
of treasury shares. 
 
at the end of the year, ambu employees had exercised 
a total of 631,293 purchase options in ambu a/s.  
 
in accordance with ambu’s remuneration policy, the 
general employee share programme established back in 
2018/19 has been vested, and ambu’s obligations in this 
respect have thus been fulfilled. consequently, the 
holding of treasury shares was reduced by 45,874 class 
b shares in ambu a/s. 
 
at the end of the year, ambu’s holding of treasury class 
b shares had been reduced by 927,167 to 3,976,471 
(4,903,638), corresponding to 1.543% (1.940%) of the 
total share capital.  
 
in addition, at the end of the year ambu employees had 
exercised a total of 175,000 warrants to subscribe for 
shares in ambu a/s. 
 
in certain jurisdictions, ambu is entitled to a deduction for 
employees’ gains on the exercise of options and 
warrants. during the year, equity was increased by dkk 
34m (dkk 40m), corresponding to the value adjustment 
of any deductible value of employee gains. 
 
cash flow statement 
 
 
cash flow from operating activities (cffo) amounted 
to dkk 328m, representing an increase of dkk 33m

corresponding to -14% (-12%) of revenue. 
 
net capital expenditure increased by dkk 145m from 
last year, driven by investments in development projects 
and the manufacturing site in mexico that is currently 
under construction.

the deferred consideration from the innovation medical 
gmbh acquisition of dkk 298m, paid in october 2020. 
the final milestone of eur 20m pertaining to the

free cash flow before acquisitions – dkkm 
 
cash flow from financing activities (cfff) amounted 
to dkk 512m (dkk 114m). ambu has raised equity of 
dkk 1,225m most of which stems from january 2021 
when ambu raised capital through an issue of new 
shares and the sale of treasury shares, generating 
proceeds of dkk 1,216m and dkk 65m, respectively. 
subsequently, debt to credit institutions of dkk 1,250m 
was repaid. in addition, dividend of dkk 73m (dkk 96m) 
has been distributed to the shareholders.  
 
changes in cash and cash equivalents then come to 
dkk -34m (dkk -21m).

follow-up on announced outlook 
relative to the results realised in 2020/21  
 
during the 2020/21 financial year, ambu adjusted the outlook for organic growth twice – in july, as we saw slower than 
expected recovery of elective procedures as well as shipment delays, and again in october, when it was clear that shipment 
delays would cause a backlog of orders to be delivered in 2021/22. at the start of the financial year, expected organic 
growth was 17-20%, and actual organic growth came to 16% at the end of the year. 
 
the guidance for the ebit margin was adjusted at the same intervals – july and october – and against the same 
background. the year ended with an ebit margin of 8.5% compared to the expectation of 11-12% at the start of the 
financial year.

q4 2020/21 
highlights 
in q4, we saw 18% organic revenue growth, driven by 
sales in visualization and pmd. the gradual return of 
elective 
procedures continued 
into 
q4, 
with 
a 
stabilisation in june and july. in august, we saw a lower 
number of elective procedures, but a continued recovery 
since mid-september. however, sales of anaesthesia 
and pmd products were impacted by shipment delays 
due to the congestion of the global container freight 
market. 
 
despite the logistical challenges, the final quarter of the 
year was also the strongest, with revenue of dkk 
1,026m.

revenue totalled dkk 1,026m (dkk 871m), with 
organic and reported growth of 18% (48% and 44%, 
respectively).  
 
gross 
profit 
was 
dkk 
610m 
(dkk 
535m), 
corresponding to a margin of 59.5% (61.4%). the gross 
margin is in line with prior quarters after adjustment for 
ordinary fluctuations in the course of business, but with 
negative impacts from raw material inflation. 
 
total capacity costs were dkk 606m (dkk 506m), up 
20% from q4 2019/20.  
 
the increase in selling and distribution costs is 
attributable to higher freight rates and volumes, 
increased use of airfreight and higher staff costs.   
 
development costs increased by dkk 23m to dkk 
73m due to higher activity levels in the clinical space.  
 
ebit was dkk 4m (dkk 29m) representing an ebit 
margin of 0.4% (3.3%).

risk management 
ambu’s business activities involve a number of inherent 
risks, and the company is exposed to risks on an ongoing 
basis which may have a negative impact on daily 
operations, financial standing, results and future growth.  
 
ambu’s 
risk 
management 
is 
focused 
on 
early 
identification of risks and rigorous assessment, but also 
increasingly on continuous mitigation, management, and 
monitoring of risks, thereby ensuring that only calculated 
risks are taken. 
 
risk reporting process and governance 
the most significant risks to ambu in the short to medium 
term are identified and assessed, and potential updates 
to the mitigation plans are reported to group risk & 
compliance on a quarterly basis. the long-term risks are 
integrated in the overall development of ambu's strategy 
and business plans. 
 
based on the reported risks, group risk & compliance 
conducts a series of in-depth interviews with risk officers 
in the organisation, after which the most significant risks 
are accessed by risk boards, before being reported to the 
executive management and the board of directors on a 
quarterly basis. 
 
the management of each function is responsible for 
identifying, assessing and managing the risks associated 
with its part of the organisation. the executive 
management is responsible for determining ambu’s 
overall risk profile in alignment with the company’s 
strategy and values. the executive management is also 
responsible for delegating responsibility for the risks that 
are shared across the organisation, as well as for 
approving the mitigating activities that address the most 
significant risks. 
 
the board of directors monitors and reviews the 
reported risks, and their planned mitigation, as well as 
any recommendations from the executive management, 
on a quarterly basis, based on the mapping of risks in the 
‘risk heat map’. 
key risks 
some risks are considered to have a significant impact 
on ambu's future operations, business and strategy. in 
the sections below, these risks are grouped into six 
overall categories, and examples of these risks as well 
as how they are mitigated are provided. 
 
innovation & development risks  
ambu’s opportunities to achieve its strategic targets 
depend on its ability to develop unique, high-quality 
products. a commercial understanding of the sector’s 
long-term needs, as well as user insights regarding 
targeted procedures in new segments and their 
integration into product development, are crucial to 
remaining a market leader. in addition, there is an 
inherent risk of ip disputes and litigation.

unlikely 
 
 
 
 
 
minor 
moderate 
major 
critical 
 
 
risk examples 
• 
insufficient capturing of user insights. 
• 
time needed to achieve the required design. 
• 
infringement of intellectual property rights that may 
reduce 
ambu’s 
competitive 
advantages 
and 
negatively impact sales. 
 
primary risk mitigation activities 
• 
products are launched in multiple segments. 
• 
the screening process for capturing user insights is 
very 
detailed 
and 
integrated 
into 
product 
development, allowing for rounds of modifications 
before the design is locked. 
• 
ip clearance processes and ip awareness training.  
 
product supply, quality and safety risks 
as a producer of medical devices, ambu must comply 
with legislation imposed by local health care authorities, 
including the new eu medical device regulation (mdr) 
and the us food and drug administration (fda). failure 
to comply may negatively impact ambu’s ability to sell its 
products. supply chain disruptions due to covid-19, 
and other major incidents occurring at the same time, 
can and may cause infrastructure congestion and 
delays, which in turn can lead to higher freight rates. 
 
risk examples 
• 
major disruption at a manufacturing facility due to a 
natural disaster or other emergency, such as a fire 
or a pandemic, may disrupt ambu’s ability to 
manufacture and distribute products.  
• 
lockdowns, breakdowns, political unrest, fires, 
natural disasters etc. at key suppliers’ sites may 
result in disruption of ambu’s supply chain. 
• 
loss of licences to sell or manufacture due to non-
compliance with legislation.  
 
impact 
likelihood 
32 
 
primary risk mitigation activities 
• 
global production with multiple facilities and re-
building safety stock. 
• 
dual sourcing, identification of high-risk suppliers 
and continuous development of contingency plans.  
• 
continuous development and improvement of 
control processes and quality procedures, and 
ongoing monitoring of legislation and market 
standards.  
 
commercial risks  
in ambu’s most important markets, there is a constant 
economic and political focus on reducing healthcare 
costs, leading to a general demand for hospitals to 
become more efficient. ambu’s anaesthesia and pmd 
businesses have historically experienced modest price 
pressure, while prices within the visualization franchise 
have been more stable.  
 
risk examples 
• 
delays in product launch and penetration into a 
market. 
• 
pace of market creation and product acceptance in 
single-use endoscopy. 
• 
economic and political development leading to 
budgetary constraints and healthcare reforms. 
 
primary risk mitigation activities 
• 
validation of value proposition in single-use, for 
instance workflow efficiency and sterility. 
• 
continuous 
improvement 
of 
product 
launch 
capabilities. 
• 
modular approach in innovation to support fast 
innovation cycle and low-cost production with 
manufacturing in low-cost jurisdictions to enable 
competitive pricing.  
 
it security risks 
globally and across most industries, a significant 
increase in cybercriminal activity, such as phishing 
campaigns and malicious websites, is taking place. 
cyber threats like cybercrime and cyberattacks are real 
and could have a major business impact, including by 
affecting ambu’s operations, delivery performance and 
competitive advantage.  
  
risk examples 
• 
breaches of it security and/or a major it 
breakdown, caused by e.g. malware attacks, could 
have a severe impact on ambu’s ability to maintain 
daily operations, resulting in disruption of sales and 
shipments to customers.  
• 
the disclosure of confidential information could 
compromise the privacy of customers or other 
individuals and business critical information could 
be lost, stolen or otherwise released into the hands 
of people for whom it was never intended. 
• 
theft of intellectual property, for instance key plans 
and descriptions of new products, may result in a 
severe impact on competitive advantage.  
 
primary risk mitigation activities 
• 
ambu is continuously improving its measures to 
monitor and respond to potential data breaches and 
cyberattacks.  
• 
our cybersecurity efforts are aligned with the 
national institute of standards and technology 
cyber security framework (nist csf) and build on 
technical, as well as human behavioural, measures.  
• 
on a regular basis, we conduct both internal and 
external 
security 
assessments, 
including 
vulnerability assessments, penetration testing and 
threat hunting. 
 
financial risks 
the development in ambu’s results and equity is subject 
to several financial risks, including foreign exchange 
risks, interest rate risks, liquidity risks and credit risks as 
well as the risk of changing international trading 
conditions. 
 
risk examples 
• 
changes to tax legislation and inherent tax risk 
associated with being a multinational company. 
• 
implementation of customs barriers and limitations 
on free trade. 
• 
fluctuations in interest rates and inflation.  
 
primary risk mitigation activities 
• 
centralisation of financial risks in the group’s 
finance function, which also serves as a service 
centre for all subsidiaries.  
• 
as a general rule, ambu relies on the neutral 
hedging of currency risks that are embedded in the 
ordinary cash flows. 
• 
the management of financial risks is described in 
further detail in note 4.1 to the consolidated financial 
statement.  
 
legal & compliance risks 
ambu operates in a highly regulated industry that is 
subject to great variation in laws and regulations across 
geographies and business areas, leading to a complex 
and often unpredictable legal environment. enforcement 
of various anti-corruption, data-privacy and healthcare-
related laws and regulations, as well as increased public 
awareness of business ethics and protection of personal 
data, contribute to an increased risk to ambu. 
 
risk examples 
• 
lawsuits filed by competitors.  
• 
violations of healthcare-related laws and non-
compliance with ambu’s codes of conduct.  
• 
investigations by authorities and/or criminal and civil 
sanctions and other penalties.  
 
primary risk mitigation activities 
• 
ongoing implementation and monitoring of ambu’s 
compliance programmes, including training and 
auditing activities. 
• 
legal reviews of key activities.  
• 
independent and confidential ethics hotline for 
reporting of unethical situations, violations and 
misconduct.

corporate governance  
corporate governance refers to the principles governing 
the management of the company, based on the 
shareholders’ views on the ownership. ambu seeks to 
establish close and trusting relations with relevant 
stakeholders, 
including 
shareholders, 
employees, 
customers, suppliers and society as a whole. we also 
seek to ensure transparency, and we want to openly 
share relevant information with our stakeholders. 
 
ambu’s board of directors complies with all of nasdaq 
copenhagen’s recommendations concerning corporate 
governance and reports on compliance on our website. 
this reporting constitutes the statutory reporting on 
corporate governance pursuant to section 107 b of the 
danish financial statements act (Årsregnskabsloven).  
shareholders 
the shareholders own ambu and exercise their right to 
make decisions at the annual general meeting, for 
example by adopting the annual report, deciding on 
amendments to the articles of association, electing 
members of the board of directors and appointing the 
company’s auditors. at the annual general meeting, 
shareholders are entitled to ask the board of directors 
and the executive management questions and to 
propose items for consideration.  
 
all shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at the 
annual general meeting. the notice convening the 
annual general meeting is published at least three weeks 
and at the most five weeks before the date of the 
meeting. the documents are sent out to shareholders 
who have requested this. the notice can also be found 
on the ambu website.  
 
ambu’s articles of association do not impose any 
restrictions on ownership or voting rights, but the share 
capital is divided into class a and class b shares. class 
a shares carry ten votes per share, while class b shares 
carry one vote per share.  
 
the class a shares are negotiable instruments, and 
according to ambu’s articles of association, the transfer 
of more than 5% of the total number of class a shares 
at a price higher than the price quoted for the company’s 
class b shares may take place only if the buyer offers all 
holders of class a and class b shares to buy their 
shares at the same price.  
 
the board of directors regularly discusses the existing 
ownership structure with the holders of class a shares. 
the board of directors and the holders of class a shares 
agree that the ownership structure has been and 
remains expedient for all of the company’s stakeholders, 
as it lays down a sound framework for the 
implementation of ambu’s strategy and plans, thereby 
safeguarding the interests of all shareholders. moreover, 
the ownership structure does not restrict the planned 
activities in any way. 
 
board of directors 
ambu has a two-tier management structure, consisting 
of 
the 
board 
of 
directors 
and 
the 
executive 
management. the two bodies are independent of each 
other, and there is no overlap in membership.  
 
on behalf of the shareholders, the board of directors is 
responsible for the overall management of ambu, 
defining strategies and setting objectives as well as 
approving the overall budgets and plans. the board of 
directors also undertakes overall supervision of the 
company’s activities and ensures that ambu is managed 
in a responsible manner and in compliance with 
legislation and the articles of association.  
 
the board of directors has established an annual 
process whereby self-evaluation of the board of 
directors’ work and performance is assessed. at least 
every three years the evaluation must be conducted by 
an experienced external facilitator. the self-evaluation in 
2020/21 led to focus areas which will be included in the 
work of the board of directors in 2021/22. 
 
composition of the board of directors 
the board of directors currently has five members who 
are elected by the shareholders at the annual general 
meeting and three members elected by the employees 
pursuant to the danish rules concerning employee 
representation. 
 
the shareholder-elected members are elected for one 
year at a time, while the employee-elected members are 
elected for four years at a time under applicable 
legislation. 
 
the chairman and the vice-chairman of the board of 
directors are elected directly by the shareholders at the 
general meeting. 
 
for 
the 
board 
of 
directors 
to 
undertake 
its 
responsibilities and act as a good sounding board for the 
executive management, the following competences are 
particularly relevant: insights into the management of a 
global growth company, insights into the medico and 
medtech industries with both public and private-sector 
customers, experience from innovation and also 
experience from the acquisition and divestment of 
enterprises, and insights into risk management and 
financial affairs. the members of ambu’s board of 
directors are deemed to possess these competences.  
 
none of the members elected by the shareholders 
represent a controlling shareholder or have direct or 
indirect interests in the company over and above their 
interests as shareholders. all members elected by the 
shareholders at the annual general meeting are 
considered to be independent members, as defined by 
the committee on corporate governance. 
  
duties of the board of directors 
the board of directors held nine (2019/20: eleven) 
meetings during the financial year. 
34 
 
moreover, the audit committee held five meetings 
(2020/21: five) during the year. the audit committee 
consists of three members of the board of directors. in 
addition, the chairman, the ceo, the cfo and the 
auditor appointed at the annual general meeting attend 
the audit committee meetings. the purpose of the 
committee is to assist the board of directors in ensuring 
the quality and integrity of the presentation of the 
company’s financial statements, reporting and auditing.  
 
the audit committee reviews and discusses ambu’s risk 
exposure and the initiatives launched to counter these 
risks. at the same time, the committee monitors all 
accounting and reporting processes, the auditing 
process and the work and independence of the external 
auditors. the charter of the audit committee and the 
review of the control and risk management systems in 
connection with the financial reporting can be found at 
www.ambu.com/auditcom. 
 
the board of directors has set up a remuneration 
committee which consists of three members of the 
board of directors. the committee held three meetings 
(2020/21: three) in the course of the financial year. 
ambu’s ceo and cfo attend the meetings. the duties 
of the committee are to ensure that the remuneration 
offered by ambu is competitive and sufficient to attract 
and retain the members of the executive management 
and to recommend future incentive schemes. the 
charter of the remuneration committee can be found at 
www.ambu.com/remcom. 
 
in addition, the board of directors has established a 
nomination committee, which consists of the chairman 
and the vice-chairman of the board of directors. the 
nomination committee held one meeting (2020/21) 
during the year. ambu’s ceo occasionally attend the 
meetings. the nomination committee is charged with 
evaluating 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
executive 
management team and with evaluating and possibly 
renewing the board of directors to ensure that the 
members of the board live up to the requirements and 
possess the skills needed. the charter of the 
nomination 
committee 
can 
be 
found 
at 
www.ambu.com/nomcom. 
executive management 
the board of directors appoints the executive 
management and lays down its terms of employment. 
the executive management is responsible for ambu’s 
day-to-day management, including the development of 
ambu’s 
activities 
and 
operations, 
and 
its 
risk 
management, financial reporting and internal affairs. the 
executive management also prepares and presents the 
company’s strategy, long-term financial planning and 
budgets to the board of directors. the delegation of 
powers and responsibilities by the board of directors to 
the executive management is described in the rules of 
procedure for ambu’s board of directors (bestyrelsens 
forretningsorden) and the provisions of the danish 
companies act (selskabsloven).  
 
the executive management consists of ceo juan jose 
gonzalez and cfo michael højgaard.  
corporate governance 
the 
board 
of 
directors 
has 
considered 
the 
recommendations from the committee on corporate 
governance (www.corporategovernance.dk) from may 
2013, as most recently amended on 23 november 2017, 
and has systematically reviewed the recommendations 
in 
a 
document 
which 
can 
be 
found 
at 
www.ambu.com/corpgov. 
 
the danish corporate governance recommendations 
of 2 december 2020 apply to ambu for the financial year 
2021/22. 
 
ambu complies with all of the recommendations of the 
committee on corporate governance. 
data ethics

policy to maintain the highest ethical standards and 
comply with all applicable data and privacy laws and 
regulations. our work with data ethics is governed by the 
data ethics policy as well as internal policies and 
standard operating procedures. please refer to the

gender diversity and board 
attendance 
report on the gender composition of the board of directors 
(members elected at the annual general meeting), pursuant to 
section 99 b, and on diversity pursuant to section 107d of the 
danish financial statements act. 
 
ambu wants the board of directors and executive 
management to be representative across genders, 
nationalities, 
ages, 
education, 
qualifications, 
competencies and thereby perspectives. the members 
should, as a group, have sufficient knowledge, insight 
and professional experience to understand ambu's 
activities and the risks related hereto. 
 
since the annual general meeting in december 2019, the 
board of directors has recruited one female member. 
our ambition is to have two female members 
corresponding to equal gender representation within a 
board of directors with 6 members. 
 
in august 2021, the board of directors announced a 
proposal that susanne larsson, cfo at mölnlycke, and 
michael del prado, former company group chairman of 
johnson & johnson medical devices, be elected as new 
members of the board of directors at the annual general 
meeting on 14 december 2021. if elected, the new 
members will further strengthen the diversity of ambu’s 
board in terms of gender and nationality. 
 
gender diversity is described in further detail in the 
social capital chapter of our 2020/21 sustainability 
report.

remuneration
remuneration policy 
ambu’s remuneration policy is complemented by the 
overall guidelines for an incentive programme for the 
executive management, which was approved at the 
annual general meeting in 2019.  
 
under the remuneration policy, it is possible to offer a 
base salary, a cash bonus element of up to 100% of the 
base salary, and a share-based element which can 
constitute up to 150% of the base salary. 
 
the remuneration policy includes pension contributions 
as well as a company car and other usual non-cash staff 
benefits. 
 
below follows a description of the most important 
elements and conditions set out in the remuneration 
policy. a more detailed description can be found in the 
remuneration 
report, 
which 
is 
available 
at 
www.ambu.com/reports. 
 
board of directors  
members of the board of directors do not receive 
variable remuneration and are not part of share-based 
incentive schemes but receive a fixed annual base fee of 
dkk 350,000, which is approved by the shareholders at 
the annual general meeting.  
 
the chairman receives three times the base fee, while 
the vice-chairman receives two times the base fee. the 
chairman of the committees receives a fee of dkk 
175,000 while members of the committees receive a fee 
of dkk 117,000. the total remuneration paid to the 
board of directors, including the board committees, 
constituted dkk 4.6m in 2020/21. (2019/20: dkk 4.2m). 
 
executive management  
the remuneration of the executive management is 
determined by the board of directors based on market 
levels, ambu’s financial position and the competences, 
efforts and results of the individual members of the 
executive management. the remuneration consists of a 
fixed base salary, a cash bonus and participation in 
share-based incentive schemes in the form of share 
options or performance share units (psus). the cash 
bonus and share-based payment depend on the financial 
results achieved by ambu. in addition, members of the 
executive management receive pension contributions 
and customary non-cash benefits. 
 
the remuneration earned by the executive management 
in 2020/21 totalled dkk 15.0m (dkk 36.7m) measured 
as the value of compensation earned in the reporting 
period. “lti” is measured as all psus achieved during 
the year’s performance, times the grant value. 
accounting adjustments for share-based payment 
settled in cash or in vesting periods are included in “adj. 
of lti to ifrs”, which then reconciles to the “total 
expense in the income statement”.

the variable remuneration reported for ceo juan jose 
gonzalez is based on psus and a cash bonus. for 
practical purposes it has been agreed to settle the psus 
in cash based on the performance of a synthetic ambu 
class b share. ifrs requires share-based payment 
settled in cash to be fair-value adjusted as an 
expense/income in opex.  
 
the notice of termination to be given by ambu to 
members of the executive management may not exceed 
18 months, and the notice of termination to be given by 
the members of the executive management to ambu 
may not normally exceed nine months.  
 
employee shares 
since 2016, all employees have had the opportunity to 
buy ambu b-shares for up to 2% of their fixed annual 
salary at a discount of 50%, provided that the shares are 
held for two years. in the last allocation in may 2021, 
approx. 1,800 employees participated, and it has been 
decided that the programme will continue in the 2021/22 
financial year. 
 
further 
detailed information 
on 
remuneration 
is 
presented in the remuneration report and in note 5.3.

shareholders and investor relations 
share capital 
ambu’s share capital is divided into two classes of 
shares, each with a nominal share value of dkk 0.50. 
class a shares carry 10 votes per share, while class b 
shares carry one vote per share. there is no difference 
between the financial rights pertaining to the individual 
share classes. all shares are paid-up in full. ambu’s 
class b share is listed on nasdaq copenhagen under 
isin code dk0060946788 and the short name of ambu-
b, while the class a share is unlisted and non-
negotiable. all class a shares are owned by the three 
lines of descendants of ambu’s founder, dr.-ing. holger 
hesse.  
 
the share capital consists of 34,320,000 class a shares 
and 223,383,932 class b shares. the total number of 
shares is 257,703,932. 
 
at ambu’s annual general meeting on 13 december 
2017, it was decided to carry out a 1:5 share split with 
effect from january 2018. after the split, ambu’s shares 
have a nominal value of dkk 0.50 each. all relevant 
ratios were restated in the 2017/18 annual report to 
reflect the share split. 
 
raising of capital, january 2021  
on 27 january 2021, ambu announced it was seeking to 
strengthen its capital base by issuing new shares and 
through the sale of treasury shares. an accelerated 
book-building process was concluded on the following 
days, and a total of 4,711,832 new class b shares and 
250,000 treasury shares were sold at a price of dkk 262 
per share. total capital of dkk 1,300m was raised. less 
transaction costs of dkk 19m, this is equivalent to net 
proceeds of dkk 1,281m in the form of a capital 
contribution of 1,216m and dkk 65m from the sale of 
treasury shares. 
 
capital increase 
besides the raising of capital in january 2021, four 
capital increases were carried out in the course of 
2020/21 in connection with employees’ exercising of 
warrants allocated in 2015 and 2016. a total of 175,000 
(1,007,500) shares were issued in this respect, at a 
weighted price of dkk 53.32 (dkk 36.52) per share with 
a nominal share value of dkk 0.50. 
 
as a consequence of the above five capital increases, 
ambu’s share capital has been increased by a total 
nominal amount of dkk 2,443,416 through the issue of 
4,886,832 class b shares. there is no change in the 
number of class a shares from last year, so that the 
number is 34,320,000 shares of dkk 0.50 each. the 
rights attached to the shares and their negotiability are 
unchanged. 
 
treasury shares 
at the end of the fiscal year, the portfolio of treasury 
shares 
comprised 
3,976,471 
shares 
(4,903,638), 
corresponding to 1.5% (1.9%) of the share capital.  
 
the reduction in treasury shares stems from the raising 
of capital in january 2021, the exercise of 631,293 share 
options and the disposal of 45,874 shares in connection 
with matching of the employee share programme from 
2018.  
 
historically, ambu has been authorised to hold up to 
10% of the company’s share capital as treasury shares 
to cover the share option schemes.  
 
return  
ambu’s class b share opened the financial year at a 
price of dkk 180 and ended the year at dkk 190, i.e., a 
change of 5%. by the end of september 2021, ambu’s 
market capitalisation equals dkk 48.2bn. in comparison, 
nasdaq copenhagen’s c25 index increased by 23% in 
the same period. over the past five years, ambu stock 
has generated an average annual (compounded) return 
to shareholders of 22%. 
 
development in share price 2020/21 (index 100)
 
 
ambu in c25 
ambu was listed in 1992 and was a small cap stock until 
january 2011, when the company was moved into the 
mid cap category. in january 2017, ambu entered the 
large cap category, and the c25 index in june 2018. 
 
liquidity  
in 2020/21, 213.2m ambu shares were traded on 
nasdaq copenhagen, equivalent to an average of 
853,128 shares per business day.  
 
shareholders  
on 30 september 2021, the total number of 
shareholders in ambu whose holdings are registered by 
name is 59,131 (45,881). they hold a combined 98% 
(88%) of the total share capital.  
 
as at 30 september 2021, the following shareholders 
had filed ownership of more than 5% of the share capital 
and/or votes:

back in 1987, a shareholders’ agreement was made by 
the holders of the class a shares, as described in the 
prospectus in connection with the listing of ambu a/s in 
1992. in november 2015, a new shareholders’ 
agreement was established between the holders of the 
class a shares, in which the agreed terms and 
conditions were updated. the updated shareholders’ 
agreement now regulates the relationship between the 
three lines of the family and the family’s views on the 
company’s 
dividend 
policy, 
the 
appointment 
of 
candidates to the board of directors of the company, 
decisions concerning the possible conversion of class a 
shares into class b shares, as well as the process of 
transferring or selling class a shares. 
 
the shareholders’ agreement solely regulates the 
family’s holdings of class a shares, while the family’s 
holdings of listed class b shares are not regulated by the 
shareholders’ agreement. moreover, ambu’s articles of 
association contain provisions on the trading of class a 
shares. 
 
in addition to the class a shares, the family holds 
approx. 13.2 million class b shares, corresponding to 
5.9% (6.1%) of the class b share capital. the family thus 
controls a total of 18.4% (18.9%) of the combined class 
a and class b share capital and 62.9% (63.6%) of the 
votes. 
 
as at 30 september 2021, international owners hold 43% 
(37%) of the share capital. international owners are 
institutional investors from e.g. the uk, germany and the 
usa. 
 
investor relations  
each quarter, a conference call is held focusing on the 
results in the past quarter, and each quarter ambu has 
attended a number of meetings and conferences with 
investors in denmark and abroad. ambu seeks active 
dialogue with investors, share analysts, journalists and 
the general public.  
 
besides 
the 
legally 
required 
reporting, 
ambu 
communicates with the market via press releases, 
investor presentations, conference calls and one-on-one 
meetings, etc. the aim is to ensure a well-founded share 
price that reflects past performance, as well as the future 
value creation of ambu.  
 
the share is covered by 11 analysts (abg sundal 
collier, carnegie bank, danske market equities, nordea

ambu’s investor relations policy prescribes a four-week 
‘quiet period’. this means that ambu will limit their 
participation in any gatherings and their comments on 
topics related to ambu’s business during a period of four 
weeks up to the release of financial reports. during the 
year, ambu issued 19 company announcements. see

proposal to the agm 
the board of directors recommends that ambu 
continues to pursue a balanced dividend policy, 
distributing approx. 30% of the net profit for the year, but 
also that the dividend policy is regularly reviewed if 
necessary investments or potential acquisitions emerge 
which may significantly impact ambu’s financial position. 
 
on this basis, the board of directors proposes to the 
annual general meeting that dividend of dkk 0.29 (dkk 
0.29) be paid per share for 2020/21, corresponding to 
30% (30%) of the net profit. the proposed dividend for 
the year is equivalent to a 3% increase compared to last 
year, and the board of directors considers this level to 
be reasonable in view of ambu’s financial resources and 
the expected results in the coming financial year. the 
board of directors proposes that the net profit for the 
year of dkk 247m be appropriated as follows (dkkm):  
 
dividend of dkk 0.29 per share 
75

payment of the dividend will take place automatically via 
vp securities a/s immediately after the annual 
general meeting. 
 
the agenda for the annual general meeting with annexes 
is expected to be announced on monday 15 november 
2021. the annual general meeting will be held on 
tuesday 14 december 2021 at 13.00 at tivoli hotel & 
congress center, arni magnussons gade 2, dk-1577

sustainability 
our sustainability report constitutes ambu’s compliance with the 
statutory disclosure on corporate social responsibility pursuant 
to section 99 a of the danish financial statements act. the 
report can be found on www.ambu.com/reports. 
 
underpinning our financial performance and strategic 
progress is a desire to act responsibly and grow 
sustainably. 
 
in the past year, we have expanded our data to 100% of 
our scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, increased our 
share of renewable electricity from 0% to 4%, increased 
the number of female executives in our top management 
to 33%, reduced the already low frequency of 
occupational injuries and trained our employees in our 
code of conduct. in addition, we have made long-term 
commitments, most notably to align our carbon emission 
targets with the paris agreement’s 1.5ºc climate goal, 
and we have renegotiated terms with credit institutions 
and the cost of financing now includes sustainability 
targets that are linked to our esg strategy. 
 
the following pages are a summary. for a broader view 
read our 2020/21 sustainability report which is available 
online. 
 
un sustainable development goals 
our targets and activities are directly linked to our 
contribution to the sdg’s.  
 
sdg 3 good health and well-being and 
sdg 8 decent work and economic growth 
in general, ambu’s products contribute to sdg 3 “ensure 
healthy lives and promote well-being for all” due to the 
nature of our products as medical devices.  
 
ambu’s contribution to sdg 8 “promote sustained, 
inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and 
productive employment and decent work for all” is 
directly linked to our company growth ambitions and 
strategy to grow sustainably for our people and our 
planet.  
 
sdg 7 affordable and clean energy, sdg 12 
responsible consumption and production and sdg 
13 climate action 
through our energy efficiency activities and our 
engagement with sbti we will increase our demand for 
renewable electricity and thereby support sdg 7 
"ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and 
modern energy for all” and sdg 13 “take urgent action 
to combat climate change and its impacts.” 
 
we contribute to sdg 12 “ensure sustainable 
consumption and production patterns” by monitoring and 
reducing energy and water consumption, as well as by 
minimising and upcycling waste and focusing on 
sustainable procurement. 
 
sdg 5 gender equality  
ambu has adopted the united nations women’s 
empowerment principles (weps) as part of our 
commitment to promote gender equality and women’s 
empowerment in the workplace. together with our 
current activities, training and development of our people 
leaders in diversity and inclusion, to ensure equal 
opportunities for men and women and equality in ambu, 
we contribution to sdg 5 “achieve gender equality and 
empower all women and girls.” 
 
sustainability & esg governance 
the sustainability & esg committee consists of 
executive vice presidents and vice presidents and 
covers all business activities. 
 
sustainability & esg activities, target and milestone 
setting, action plans, and data registration and collection 
are anchored in the respective business areas in which 
they originate with the sustainability & esg committee 
member holding overall responsibility. the esg 
department facilitates and coordinates all corporate 
sustainability & esg activities, to ensure compliance and 
41 
 
adherence to legislation, commitments and stakeholder 
expectations. 
 
sustainability highlights 
 
2025 target co2 reduction 
in august 2021, we committed to setting carbon 
emission reduction targets in line with the science based 
targets initiative (sbti). ambu expects continued 
business growth over the coming years and we must 
therefore decouple our carbon emissions from our 
growth and reduce both our absolute and relative 
emissions in the years to come. 
 
our strategy is three-fold and includes short- and long-
term initiatives: minimise carbon emissions from 
production sites through energy efficiency measures, 
purchase renewable energy certificates (recs) with 
focus on additionality and establish power purchase 
agreements (ppas). we aim to be able to submit and 
have our targets validated and accepted by the sbti in 
2021/22. 
 
during 2020/21, we expanded the data collection 
process in order to get a full picture of our scope 1 and 
2 emissions and have now included: 
• 
electricity used in all of ambu’s leased international 
offices and warehouses. 
• 
fuel consumption in all leased and owned company 
cars. 
• 
fugitive emissions from leakage of cooling agents 
at our production sites and headquarters. 
to enable comparison over the last three years, the new 
emission sources are summarised and visualised in light 
blue on top of how emissions were calculated for the 
previous years. 
disregarding the new emission sources, ambu’s scope 
1+2 emissions have decreased by 5% compared to 
2019/20. 
 
disregarding the new emission sources, the intensity 
metric of co2 per tonne manufactured is 1.75, which is 
an 8% decrease compared to 2019/20. the decrease is 
attributable to an increase of 3.5% in our production yield 
and a decrease in carbon emissions from production 
sites and headquarters. 
 
 
disregarding the new emissions, the intensity metric of 
co2/revenue is 4.55, which is a 16% decrease 
compared to 2019/20. the decrease is attributable to 
reduced carbon emissions from production sites and 
headquarters, together with a 13% increase in revenue. 
 
 
 
 
our sustainability targets 
42 
 
renewable energy  
the solar panels at our production site in penang, 
malaysia, have generated 1,510 mwh renewable, 
corresponding to 10% of the electricity used on site. 
 
2025 target: pvc-free products  
during 2020/21, we launched two new products, of which 
one product is pvc-free. 
 
2025 target: packaging 
during 2020/21, we collected packaging data from our 
three production sites: weight, material and whether it is 
recyclable, reusable or compostable. 
 
a total of 654 packaging variants were used in 2018/19. 
of these, it has been possible to assess the recyclability 
of 638 variants, equivalent to 98%. based on this 
assessment, we find that 36% of the packaging variants 
are recyclable. 502 packaging variants out of the 654 
have been fully mapped, corresponding to 77%. 
 
on considering the fully mapped packaging variants 
solely in terms of weight shipped, we can see that 78% 
of the packaging is recyclable.  
 
the difference between recyclable packaging variants 
and recyclable packaging shipped is attributable to the 
distribution of non-recyclable light-weight packaging 
types, e.g. labels and sterile pouches, and recyclable 
heavier packaging such as cardboard boxes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
esg data summary 
2023 target: 40% women in management 
in 2020/21, the proportion of women among all 
managers decreased. this can be attributed to a 
decrease in the proportion of women managers in our 
emea & la sales organisation, as well as in penang. a 
minor increase of one percentage point was seen in the 
proportion of white-collar managers, while a major step 
was taken regarding the gender diversity of the 
executive leadership team, which increased from 25% 
to 33% female members. the executive leadership 
team currently comprises 12 executives with global 
responsibilities as well as the heads of the sales regions. 
 
while some parts of the organisation have already 
achieved the target of 40% female representation, we 
continue to work to increase gender diversity across all 
of ambu.

esg data summary (continued) 
 
 
[1] includes emissions from our three production sites and headquarters. [2] includes emissions from our three production sites and 
headquarters (incl. company cars). [3] includes emissions from our three production sites, offices and company cars, and fugitive 
emissions from refrigerants (from production sites and headquarter). [4] ambu is dedicated to reporting all greenhouse gases (carbon 
dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) and therefore always seeks to use conversion factors displayed as co2e. of nine conversion factors, 
two are not available as co2e (electricity in china and district heating in hq). [5] the employee turnover rate for all employees and the 
sickness absence rate for 2019/20 have been restated, as we detected errors in the data reported last year. years prior to that have not 
been restated. [6] the gender pay ratio for indirect blue-collar and blue-collar employees had been switched in 2019/20. this has been 
corrected.

the management.  
 
all the companies in the ambu group follow the same accounting policies, and the basic practice is described in this 
section. the specific accounting policies are included under the respective notes in sections 2-5.

principles of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as issued by 
the international accounting standards board (iasb), ifrs as adopted by the eu and additional requirements in the danish financial 
statements act. the group’s ultimate parent company, ambu a/s, is a public limited company domiciled in denmark.
the annual report has been prepared in accordance with the historical cost principle, except for derivative financial instruments and contingent 
consideration for business combinations, which are measured at fair value.
the accounting policies described below have been applied consistently in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in the 
years presented. the accounting policies have been applied consistently with prior year.
the consolidated financial statements comprise ambu a/s and companies in which ambu a/s has a controlling interest. control is deemed to 
be obtained if ambu a/s owns more than 50% of the voting rights, or if ambu a/s in any other way has a controlling interest in the company. 
the subsidiaries’ financial statements are adjusted if necessary to ensure that their accounting policies are consistent with those of the rest of 
the group. all intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are fully eliminated on consolidation. 
the consolidated financial statements represent matters that have been deemed to be material or required under the ifrs provisions or 
additional requirements in the danish financial statements act.
ambu includes qualitative and quantitative factors when assessing whether a relationship is material. if the presentation or disclosure of a 
matter does not increase the informative value for the person reading the financial statements, the matter is deemed to be immaterial. 
the consolidated financial statements are presented in danish kroner (dkk), which is also ambu a/s’ functional currency. all amounts are 
rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise stated.  
the financial statements of the parent company, ambu a/s, are presented separately from the consolidated financial statements and can be 
found on the last pages of this report. the parent company’s separate accounting policies are shown in conjunction with the financial 
statements of the parent company. 
the group’s general accounting policies are described below. in connection with this, specific accounting policies have been incorporated into 
each of the individual notes to the consolidated financial statements:
in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the management makes material accounting estimates, 
assessments and assumptions which form the basis of the presentation, recognition and measurement of the group’s assets and liabilities for 
accounting purposes. 
the estimates made are based on assumptions deemed to be reasonable by the management, but which are naturally subject to uncertainty. 
such assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unexpected events or incidents may occur. furthermore, the company is subject to 
risks and uncertainties which may cause the realised results to deviate from the estimates.
information about material estimates, assessments and assumptions applied where a change will significantly impact the consolidated 
financial statements is included in the following notes:

the group has adopted all relevant new and updated accounting standards issued by the iasb effective as at 1 october 2020. 
a functional currency is determined for each company in the ambu group. the functional currency is the currency used in the primary 
economic environment in which the individual subsidiary operates. 
transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate applicable at the transaction date. foreign 
exchange gains and losses in connection with the settlement of these transactions and the translation of monetary assets and liabilities in 
foreign currencies at the exchange rates applicable at the balance sheet date are recognized in the income statement under net financials.
receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange 
rate applicable at the balance sheet date. the difference between the exchange rate applicable at the balance sheet date and the exchange 
rate applicable at the date on which the receivable or payable occurred or the exchange rate stated in the most recent annual report is 
recognized in the income statement under net financials.
the financial statements of subsidiaries with a functional currency different than dkk are translated to danish kroner at the exchange rates for 
balance sheet items applicable at the balance sheet date and at average exchange rates as far as income statement items are concerned. 
exchange rate differences arising from the translation of the net assets of such subsidiaries at the beginning of the year using the exchange 
rates applicable at the balance sheet date and the translation of income statement items from the exchange rates applicable at the 
transaction date to the exchange rates applicable at the balance sheet date are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented as 
a separate reserve for foreign currency translation adjustments under equity.
income and expenses are recognized according to the accruals concept. the income statement is presented by functions where the 
respective cost impacts the function to which the cost is deemed to relate. the group’s functions are divided into production, sales and 
distribution, development, as well as management and administration.
production costs comprise costs incurred in generating the revenue for the year. production costs include direct and indirect costs for raw 
materials and consumables, freight costs incurred in connection with the purchase of commodities etc., production wages and salaries for 
support functions and factory management, as well as depreciation and impairment of plant and depreciation of leases.
selling and distribution costs comprise costs for sales staff, advertising and exhibitions, depreciation, impairment and operation of central 
warehouses, as well as all costs relating to the transport of goods from the group’s factories to the customers. 
development costs comprise salaries and costs which, directly or indirectly, can be attributed to product improvements and the development 
of new products which do not meet the criteria for capitalization of an internally generated development project. in addition, the amortization 
and impairment of capitalized development costs as well as amortization of rights and acquired technologies are recognized.
administrative expenses comprise expenses incurred for management and administration, including expenses for the administrative staff, 
office premises and office expenses, as well as amortization and impairment, and depreciation of leases.
prepayments recognized under assets comprise costs incurred in respect of the coming financial year measured at cost. 
reserve for foreign currency translation adjustments in the consolidated financial statements comprises exchange rate differences arising from 
the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries to dkk as well as foreign currency translation adjustments of intercompany 
balances regarded as a supplement to the net investment in foreign subsidiaries. 
other relevant standards and interpretations adopted by the iasb, but not yet in force in the eu, have not been incorporated into this annual 
report. these standards and interpretations are expected to be adopted when they become mandatory.

business combinations
cash flow statement
leases concluded are considered to be non-cash transactions. cash flows relating to assets held under leases are recognized as payment of 
interest and repayment of debt. cash flow from financing activities comprise changes to the size or composition of share capital and costs 
incidental thereto as well as the arrangement of loans, the repayment of interest-bearing debt, the purchase and sale of treasury shares and 
the payment of dividend to the group’s shareholders.
the cash flow statement has been prepared on the basis of the indirect method and shows the group’s cash flows from operating, investing 
and financing activities for the year. cash flow from operating activities comprises operating profit (ebit) adjusted for non-cash operating items, 
changes in net working capital, net financials received and paid and income tax paid. cash flow from investing activities comprises payments 
made in connection with the acquisition and disposal of enterprises and activities, as well as investment, development, sale and improvements 
of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
cash flows denominated in currencies other than danish kroner (dkk) are translated using average exchange rates, unless such rates deviate 
materially from the exchange rates applicable on the transaction date.
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash less short-term bank debt, alternating between positive and negative balances. 
newly acquired enterprises are included in the consolidated financial statements as from the date of acquisition. comparative figures are not 
restated for newly acquired enterprises. in connection with the acquisition of new enterprises in which ambu obtains a controlling influence, 
the purchase method is applied. the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired enterprises are measured at fair 
value at the date of acquisition. identifiable intangible assets are recognized, provided that such assets can be recognized separately or 
originate from a contractual right and the fair value can be measured reliably. deferred tax on the revaluations made is recognized. the date of 
acquisition is the date when ambu obtains actual control of the acquired enterprise.
for business combinations, the positive balances (goodwill) between the cost of the enterprise and the fair value of the acquired identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognized as goodwill under intangible assets. the cost of the enterprise is made up of the fair 
value of the agreed consideration, including any contingent consideration. goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment 
test. the first impairment test is carried out at the end of the year of acquisition. upon acquisition, goodwill is attributed to the cash-generating 
units, which will subsequently form the basis of an impairment test. goodwill and fair value adjustments in connection with the acquisition of a 
foreign entity with another functional currency than dkk are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated to the 
functional currency of such entity using the exchange rate applicable at the transaction date. transaction costs incurred in connection with 
business combinations are expensed.

section 2: 
operating profit and tax 
 
this section contains notes relating to the net profit for the year from the group’s activities.  
 
in 2020/21, ambu reported ebit of dkk 340m (dkk 428m), corresponding to a margin of 8.5%, down 3.5 percentage 
points from last year’s ebit margin of 12.0%.  
 
this year’s ebit decrease of 21% to dkk 340m can be ascribed to various drivers. gross profit increased by dkk 
291m, driven by reported revenue growth of 13%. total capacity costs increased by dkk 379m from last year to dkk 
2,163m, corresponding to 54% of revenue (50%), primarily driven by an increase in staff costs of dkk 291m. on the 
other hand, the year-on-year effect of bad debt reserves related to covid-19 was a reduction in costs of dkk 46m.

ambu is a supplier of medtech products for the global market. except for the sales of the various products, no structural or organizational 
aspects allow for a division of earnings from individual products, as sales channels, customer types and sales organizations are identical for 
all important markets. furthermore, production processes and internal controls and reporting are identical, which means that, with the 
exception of revenue, everything else is unsegmented. ambu has thus identified one segment.
the group operates in three geographical regions: north america, europe and rest of world. the geographical distribution of revenue is based 
on the country in which the goods are delivered. see note 2.2 for a breakdown of revenue on geography and countries that individually 
represent more than 10% of the group's revenue. the majority of the group’s intangible and tangible assets are located in denmark as the 
parent company owns the group's intellectual property rights. denmark accounts for dkk 1,902m (dkk 1,565m) of the figures in europe 
presented below. employed assets in north america and rest of world primarily relates to the group's production facilities. the management 
monitors goodwill as a whole, and goodwill is thus not allocated to geographical areas.

group's domicile country, denmark, is included in europe at dkk 44m (2019/20: dkk 49m).
the group's primary performance obligation is the sale and delivery of medico products to customers. the performance obligation is fulfilled 
when the risk of the goods is passed to the buyer, which most often occurs at delivery at the customer's address. due to the group's focus 
on disposable devices, the group is not subject to any material guarantee obligations and customers are not entitled to return unused goods.
the group's customers have payment terms that reflect the market in which the sale takes place, which varies from 15 to 360 days. for the 
majority of sales payment terms are 15-60 days. historically, the group has not experienced any major losses on trade receivables but a 
provision was allocated during the covid-19 pandemic. see note 3.6 on trade receivables and note 4.1 on credit risks.
revenue from the sale of goods is recognized in the income statement when all performance obligations have been fulfilled. revenue is 
measured at the fair value of the agreed consideration, exclusive of vat and taxes collected on behalf of a third party. at the time of 
recognition of income, a number of price adjustments are also estimated. these are recognized as a reduction to revenue.
price adjustments are offset against trade receivables and primarily concern sales in the usa. price adjustments in the us market are 
subject to estimation uncertainty as the actual price adjustment is not determined until the dealer’s sale to the end-customer (hospitals, 
clinics etc.). price adjustments are the difference between the price agreed with the end-customer and the dealer’s list price. price 
adjustments in the amount of dkk 61m (2020: dkk 43m) were recognized.

the largest part of ambu’s revenue, production costs and capacity costs is invoiced and paid in foreign currencies, and all assets and 
liabilities in the subsidiaries’ balance sheets are denominated in foreign currency. as a consequence, fluctuations in these exchange rates 
against dkk might impact ambu’s financial position and results. the most important exchange rates in relation to risk exposure are usd, 
myr, cny and gbp (collectively referred to as ‘main currencies’). furthermore, eur is a currency with large exposure, but the risk is 
deemed limited due to dkk being pegged to eur.
the following table shows the impact on the group's net profit in the event of a 10% fluctuation in the main currencies relative to the 
recognized financial instruments. the fluctuation of 10% constitutes the management’s assessment of a realistic exchange rate development 
within the main currencies. the financial instruments comprised by the sensitivity analysis include trade receivables, cash, payables, trade 
payables and intercompany balances.

interest rate swaps have been entered into to hedge the group’s partial debt to credit institutions, converting floating-rate debt into fixed-rate

consequently fair value adjustments are taken to financials. refer to note 4.1 and note 4.2.

§ accounting policies
the tax for the year, which consists of current tax and changes in deferred tax, is recognized in the income statement with the portion 
attributable to the profit for the year, and in equity with the portion attributable to amounts recognized directly in other comprehensive income. 
the tax effect of share-based payment is included in tax on profit for the year with the portion attributable to the group’s deductible share of 
the cost from the black-scholes or other applied valuation model, and the remaining tax effect being included in equity. tax is provided on the 
basis of the tax rules and tax rates applicable in the individual countries.
ambu develops, manufactures and sells devices to hospitals and rescue services all over the world through its own companies or in 
collaboration with third parties. this naturally leads to cross-border transactions. in order to counter the inherent tax risk associated with 
being a multinational company, ambu follows the oecd’s transfer pricing principles and general guidelines. even though ambu operates in 
oecd member countries, a tax risk still exists given the fact that applicable principles and guidelines are, to some extent, subject to 
interpretation by the member countries and that applicable case law is not always clear and changes over time. 
to counter any future tax disputes and disagreements with the authorities, the management makes estimates and assessments of the 
group’s tax exposure and, on the basis thereof, makes a provision for uncertain tax positions. even though the management considers this 
provision to be sufficient, future liabilities may deviate from this. 
our work with income taxes is governed by the tax policy, approved by the board of directors. ambu's policy is to have a low tax risk 
appetite and to refrain from having business in tax havens or low tax jurisdictions for the purpose of conducting tax optimisation. in 2021, 
ambu ag was incorporated in switzerland for the commercial reason of starting to sell directly in the market.
paid income tax for the year was dkk 27m, corresponding to 9% of realized profit before tax. the reason for the low effective tax payment 
predominantly stems from capital expenditures and deductions from the employees' gains from exercised warrants and share options. the 
previous year's tax payment was dkk 102m due to an intercompany transfer of intellectual property rights from a subsidiary to ambu a/s.

in recognising tax loss carry-forwards in denmark, the management has assessed whether convincing evidence was present as the group 
has a history of recent losses in denmark, which is due to high investment levels and tax deductibility of employees' share-based payments.
as shown in the table below, tax loss carry-forwards of dkk 383m were recognized in 2020/21 (2020: dkk 245m) of which dkk 378m is tax 
loss carry-forwards in denmark. the tax loss carry-forwards are recognized on the basis of budgets, strategy plans for the individual activities 
approved by the management incl. tax planning opportunities that will advance the taxable profit. estimates and assessments of future 
taxable income are thus consistent with the basis for the impairment tests and the measurement of contingent consideration carried out. 
in germany, unrecognized temporary deductible differences amounted to dkk 23m (2020: dkk 23m).

2.7 deferred tax (continued)
§ accounting policies
adjustment is made of deferred tax in relation to eliminations made as regards unrealised intercompany profits and losses.
deferred tax is measured on the basis of the taxation rules and tax rates which, pursuant to the legislation in force at the balance sheet date, 
will apply in the individual countries at the time when the deferred tax is expected to become payable as current tax. changes in deferred tax 
resulting from changes in tax rates are recognized in the income statement.
deferred tax is measured under the balance-sheet liability method on the basis of all temporary differences between the carrying amount and 
tax base of assets and liabilities. deferred tax is not recognized on temporary differences resulting from the initial recognition of goodwill. 
deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carry-forwards, are recognized under other non-current assets at the expected usable 
value, either as a set-off against tax on future income or as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities in the same legal tax entity.
deferred tax is calculated on share-based payments to the extent that the individual scheme is deductible for the group. deferred tax is 
calculated as the difference between the value of the share-based payment at the time of allocation and the fair value, whichever is higher. 
deferred tax assets from share-based payment schemes are recognized proportionately over the vesting period. the tax asset is recognized 
in the income statement at a value corresponding to the tax deduction for the scheme-related costs recognized in the income statement. any 
additional values are recognized directly in equity.
the value of deductible temporary differences is recognized to the extent that the management, on the basis of budgets, business plans etc., 
is able to render probable that the value can be offset against temporary deferred tax liabilities or against future taxable income. tax losses 
are recognized to the extent that the management can render probable that these can be offset against future taxable income.

profit for the year divided by the average number of outstanding shares. diluted earnings per share are calculated as the net profit for the year 
divided by the sum of the average number of outstanding shares including the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based payment settled in 
shares that are ‘in the money’. the dilutive effect of share-based payment that are ‘in the money’ is calculated as the difference between the 
number of shares that could be acquired at fair value for the proceeds from the exercise of the share-based payment offset against the share of 
the granted fair value of the share-based payment not yet recognized.

invested capital 
at the end of september 2021, the invested capital totalled dkk 4,711m (2020: dkk 3,718m), corresponding to an 
increase of dkk 993m. the increase is driven by investments in intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and 
net working capital, and paid milestone in connection with the fda clearance of the duodenoscope.

net working capital  
at the end of september 2021, net working capital was dkk 789m (dkk 581m), corresponding to 20% (16%) of 
revenue. the increase in % of revenue (nwc%) is driven by inventories and trade receivables.  
 
the physical location of our factories in asia entails transport times of up to eight weeks from the factories to the regional 
warehouses in europe and the usa. we are currently experiencing additional lead times throughout our global supply 
chain, due to container congestion, which is driving the dkk 233m inventory increase from last year to dkk 748m by the 
end of the year.  
 
trade receivables are 17% of revenue or dkk 699m (2020: dkk 521m), up dkk 178m from last year. the underlying 
performance for collection of debt is good, and the increase can be attributed to the timing of sales within the quarter.

impairment testing
§ accounting policies
cost at 30 september
the ambu group is managed as one single unit, for which reason the management monitors goodwill as a whole at group level. consequently, 
the impairment test is based on the group’s total cash flows. the market value of ambu a/s’s shares based on the quoted price of dkk 190 
per share on nasdaq copenhagen at 30 september 2021 is far higher than the carrying amount of equity. based on this market value 
approximation, ambu's equity value is dkk 48bn which leaves dkk 44bn in headroom to the carrying amount of equity. therefore, the 
management has concluded that the net selling price calculated on the basis of a level 1 fair value measurement proves that there is no 
indication of impairment of goodwill. 
the carrying amount of goodwill at dkk 1,504m (dkk 1,497m) stems primarily from the business combinations of invendo medical gmbh in 
2017 and king systems corp. in 2013.
on recognition, goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired company. 
subsequently, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. goodwill is not amortized.
at the time of acquisition, goodwill is attributed to the cash-generating units which are expected to benefit from the business combination; 
however, not to a level lower than the segment level and the level on which goodwill is monitored as part of the internal financial management. 
the management has identified one operating segment being the whole group to which goodwill is allocated. 
the carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment together with the other non-current assets of the cash-generating unit to which 
goodwill has been allocated (being the whole group) and is impaired to the recoverable amount in the income statement if the carrying amount 
is higher. impairment of goodwill is recognized as a separate item in the income statement. goodwill is tested annually for impairment, the first 
time being by the end of the year of recognition in connection with a business combination.
impairment of goodwill is not reversed. impairment of other assets is reversed in so far as the assumptions and estimates on the basis of 
which the impairment is made have been changed. impairments are only reversed in so far as the new carrying amount of the asset does not 
exceed the carrying amount of the asset after amortization, had the asset not been impaired.

development projects that are clearly defined and identifiable and where the technical utilization degree, sufficient resources and a potential 
future market or scope for use in the group can be proven, and where the group intends to produce, market or use the project, are recognized 
as intangible assets where the cost of the project can be calculated reliably and there is sufficient certainty that the future earnings or the net 
selling price can cover the production costs, selling and distribution costs as well as management and administrative expenses. other 
development costs are recognized in the income statement as incurred.
recognized development costs are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. cost comprises salaries and 
other external expenses, e.g. consultancy fees and travel expenses, which are directly attributable to the group’s development activities.
acquired technologies, trademarks and customer relations primarily comprise identified technologies. the individual assets are systematically 
amortized according to the straight-line method over the expected useful lifetime of the assets from the time the management finds that the 
technology is fit for use. the expected useful lifetime is 5-15 years.
technologies, trademarks and customer relationships and technologies in progress acquired in connection with business combinations, are 
recognized at fair value on the time of acquisition in connection with a business combination. subsequently, the assets are measured less 
accumulated amorization and impairment losses. 
the management performs an annual assessment of whether internal or external indications of impairment of the identified intangible assets 
exist. if there is any indication of impairment, an impairment test is carried out.
in an impairment test, significant estimates and assessments are made of future events which may have a significant impact on the group’s 
operating profit (ebit) and financial position if the planned events deviate from the management’s best estimate. 
development projects in progress, either acquired or internally generated, are tested for impairment on an annual basis. for completed 
development projects, it is continuously assessed whether there is any indication of impairment. if the management finds that there is an 
indication of impairment, an impairment test is carried out, comparing the estimated future net cash flows with the carrying amount of the 
asset. the impairment tests made have not resulted in any indication of impairment. 
rights in the form of distribution rights and licences etc. are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. rights 
are amortized according to the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining term of the agreement and the useful lives of the assets.
development projects and rights are amortized according to the straight-line method over the expected useful lives of the assets. the expected 
useful lifetime of completed development projects are 5-10 years and 5-20 years for rights.
upon completion of the development activity, development projects are amortized according to the straight-line method over the estimated 
useful life as from the time when the asset is ready for use. the basis of amortization is reduced by impairment losses, if any. the useful life of 
the asset may subsequently be changed if the management believes that the original assumptions on which the useful life and any residual 
value are based have changed significantly.

land is not depreciated.
depreciation is recognized in the income statement under production costs, selling and distribution costs, development costs or management 
and administrative expenses, as appropriate. see note 2.4.
land and buildings, plant and machinery and other plant, fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. cost comprises the acquisition price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the date 
when the asset is ready for use. the cost of a total asset is divided into separate elements which are depreciated individually when the useful 
lives of the individual elements differ. software and it projects are classified as other fixtures and equipment. 
the basis of depreciation is calculated in consideration of the residual value of the asset and is reduced by impairment losses, if any. the 
residual value is fixed at the date of acquisition and is subject to annual review. when the residual value exceeds the carrying amount of the 
asset, depreciation will no longer take place. in connection with changes in the depreciation period or the residual value, the effect of 
depreciation is recognized in future as a change in the accounting estimate.
property, plant and equipment are depreciated according to the straight-line method over the expected useful lives of the assets/components 
as follows:
the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is assessed on an annual basis to establish whether there is any indication of 
impairment. when such indication exists, an impairment test is performed. an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an 
asset exceeds the recoverable amount of the asset.

§ accounting policies
lease assets are ‘right-of-use assets’, which is a contract or part of a contract that conveys the lessee’s right to use an asset for a period of 
time. at the commencement date, the group recognises a lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset at the same amount. a right-
of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which equals the initial lease liability and initial direct costs less any lease incentives received. the 
group has applied the practical expedient option allowed under ifrs by using a portfolio approach for the recognition of lease contracts 
related to assets of the same nature and with similar lease terms.  
the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the earlier of the lease term or the useful life of the asset. the impairment testing of right-of-use 
assets follows the same principles as those applied for property, plant and equipment, cf. note 3.3. the cost price is adjusted for 
remeasurement of the lease liability. the group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with a term of 12 
months or less and leases of low-value assets. lease payments related to such leases are recognised in the income statement as an 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

materials and consumables comprises the acquisition price plus delivery costs.
the cost of manufactured goods comprises the cost of raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and production overheads in the form

credit risks
§ accounting policies
trade receivables are measured at amortized cost less write-down for lifetime expected credit losses. to measure the expected credit losses, 
trade receivables are grouped according to shared credit risk characteristics and days overdue. furthermore, an allowance for lifetime credit 
losses for trade receivables is recognized on initial recognition.
ambu monitors trade receivables on a daily basis by means of due date reports, changes in payment pattern trends, and ordinary follow-up 
routines to identify any indications that the initial expectations for credit losses on the individual receivables should be adjusted. in addition to 
a specific assessment for expected credit losses on trade receivables, the management estimates general macro risks on the portfolio of 
trade receivables. the group does not use factoring in connection with the collection of debts. see note 4.1 for a more detailed description of 
credit risks.
last year, the management deemed a higher risk of private customers going into default due to cutting back on more lucrative procedures in 
their treatment of covid-19 patients. against this background, an additional accrual of dkk 31m was provided for at 30 september 2020. 
since then no significant bad debt has been realised and management now assesses the risk to have diminished. consequently, the covid-
19 accrual was partly released in q2 2020/21 by dkk 15m making the year-over-year effect in opex a reduced cost of dkk 46m.

section 4: 
financial risk management and capital structure 
this section provides an overview of ambu’s capital structure and net financials as well as a description of the measures 
taken by the management to prevent and reduce the financial risks to which ambu is exposed.  
 
ambu realised a debt multiple of 1.4 (2.2), comprising ebitda of dkk 556m (dkk 609m) and net interest-bearing debt 
(nibd) of dkk 759m, down dkk 587m from last year’s dkk 1,346m. the net reduction in nibd can be ascribed to the 
negative free cash flow of dkk 245m, paid milestone of dkk 298m, paid dividend of dkk 73m, and commenced lease 
agreements of dkk 117m, less the capital contribution and sale of treasury shares in january 2021, which raised net 
proceeds of dkk 1,281m.  
 
 
net-interest bearing debt (nibd) at 30 september 2020 bridged to nibd end of the year, in dkkm 
 
 
 
net financials were dkk -32m down from last year’s dkk -106m, primarily due to fair value adjustment of contingent 
consideration at dkk -10m (dkk -48m) and net foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

4.1 financial risk management
market risk
currency risk
interest rate risk
liquidity and financing risk
credit risk
counterparty risk
counterparty risk for cash and financial instruments are mitigated as the company's primary banks are sifi banks.
ambu is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates. furthermore, ambu is exposed to liquidity and financing risks. these 
risks are managed and monitored centrally in the parent company in accordance with the treasury policy approved by the board of 
directors. ambu does not undertake any active speculation in financial risks.
the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on the group’s financial targets has been monitored throughout fy2020/21. during 
fy2020/21 a comprehensive analysis was conducted to compare the pros and cons of establishing a systematic foreign exchange hedging 
programme with the objective to mitigate the effect on future cash flows from fluctuating foreign exchange rates. the analysis concluded that 
the company until further notice will rely on the natural hedging that the current mix of foreign exchange entails. see note 2.6 for further 
information about foreign currency exposure and the 'outlook for 2021/22' section in the management's commentary section. 
ambu's policy is to hedge the interest rate risk to a level that will leave enough room for appropriate reductions of debt from cash flows based 
on short to mid-term cash flow projections. hedging is done through interest rate swaps converting floating-rate loans into fixed-rate loans. 
the group’s credit facilities carry floating interest rate. the development in interest rates is linked to cibor rates for the relevant periods.
the company has entered into a dkk 500m interest rate swap involving receipt of cibor 3 months and payment of a fixed interest rate. this 
instrument does not contain a ‘floor’ on cibor 3 months, as is the case for the secured debt. despite the lack of a ‘floor’ in the hedging 
instrument, the management initially deemed that an economic relationship existed as an interest rate increase was deemed to be more 
likely than a further decline in interest rates. since 2018/19, the hedge instrument has been ineffective as cibor 3 months carries negative 
interests. 
as described above, the group is exposed to changes in foreign exchange and interest rate risks. additionally, the group is exposed to 
changing raw materials prices and freight rates. ambu's global procurement and global supply chain function, respectively, monitor these 
risk and work to mitigate them to the greatest extent possible. the management assesses these risks to be manageable as they represent a 
small value of the group's total cost, despite substantial increases seen in comparison to last year. 
ambu is mainly exposed to credit risks in respect of trade and other receivables. the maximum credit risk corresponds to the carrying 
amount. for many years the overall credit risk has been deemed to be low, due to the small losses realised on debtors.  
individually outstanding trade receivables are also monitored on a regular basis, which is based on concrete debtor assessments of private 
customers. public-sector customers are an important part of the company’s receivables, and it is believed that no debtor risks are associated 
with public-sector customers. reference is made to note 3.6.
a likely decline in interest rates of 0.25 percentage points will result in an expense of dkk 1m (dkk 2m) in the income statement, whereas a 
likely increase in interest rates of 0.50 percentage points will result in an expense of dkk 1m (income of dkk 1m), of which all will be 
recognized in the income statement.
financing and sufficient liquidity are fundamental to ambu’s continued operation and growth. liquidity is managed centrally from the parent 
company. the objective of the cash management is to ensure a return for the shareholders and to ensure that adequate and flexible cash 
resources are being maintained, thus enabling ambu to honour its current obligations, such as repaying loans and settling other liabilities.
to cover the group’s liquidity needs, an agreement on credit facilities for a total of dkk 1,500m has been entered into. the facilities carry 
floating interest, the minimum interest rate being 0.575-1.175%, depending on the group’s gearing and esg performance. to hedge the 
interest rate risk, dkk 500m of the debt has been hedged through an interest rate swap up until 1 march 2022 at a fixed interest rate of 
between 1.28% and 1.78%, depending on gearing. the credit facility is revolving and expires on 28 june 2024, but can be prolonged up to two 
years. the group's credit facilities are subject to standard financial covenants.
the cash resources consist of cash at bank and unutilised credit facilities in banks of dkk 1.0bn (2020: dkk 1.2bn).
cash-pool solutions are applied to a small extent and intercompany loans have been granted by ambu a/s to a few subsidiaries. the liquidity 
risk is countered by a consistent focus on budgeted and realised cash flow.
last year, the management deemed that there was a higher risk of private customers going into default due to cutting back on more lucrative 
procedures in their treatment of covid-19 patients. at september 30 2020 this led to a write-down of dkk 35m related to the uncertainties 
regarding covid-19. since then no significant bad debt has been realised and the management now assesses the risk to have diminished. 
consequently, the overall provision for bad debt has been reduced to dkk 21m from dkk 38m for the prior year.

§ accounting policies
other liabilities are measured at amortized cost.
at the end of the financial year, it is assessed whether an instrument has moved between the levels of the fair value hierarchy. there have 
been no movements between the various levels this year or the year before. 
changes in the part of the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as and fulfilling the criteria for hedging future cash flows, and 
which, in an efficient manner, hedge changes in the value of the hedged item, are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented as 
a separate reserve for hedging transactions under equity until the hedged transaction is realised. at this time, gains or losses on such hedging 
transactions are transferred from equity and recognized under the same item as the hedged item. when hedging proceeds from future 
borrowings, the gains or losses on hedging transactions are, however, transferred from other comprehensive income over the term of the loan.
for derivative financial instruments which do not fulfil the conditions for treatment as a hedging instrument, changes in the fair value are 
recognized on an ongoing basis in the income statement. 
contingent consideration arising as a result of business combinations is recognized at fair value at the time of acquisition. the liability is 
subsequently adjusted to fair value on an ongoing basis. 
derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value based on a valuation report prepared by an external party who valuates the 
instruments based on discounted cash flows, and other inputs based on observable market data.
contingent consideration is recognized at fair value by discounting expected cash flows based on contractual conditions and unobservable 
inputs such as the expected performance of the acquired assets.
ambu’s contingent consideration is recognised and measured at fair value using unobservable data (level 3) and includes the contingent 
consideration from the acquisition of invendo medical gmbh. the contingent consideration relates to the commercialisation of the technologies 
acquired from invendo medical gmbh in october 2017. the key assumptions in the valuation of the contingent consideration include future 
revenue from the acquired technologies, fda approval of each endoscope as well as the discount rate of 18% applied.
debt to credit institutions etc. is recognized at the date of borrowing at fair value corresponding to the proceeds received less transaction 
costs paid. in subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the ‘effective rate of interest method’ so that 
the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognized under financial expenses in the income statement for the duration of 
the loan term.
derivative financial instruments are recognized as from the transaction date and are measured at fair value in the balance sheet. the fair value 
of derivative financial instruments is calculated on the basis of current market data as well as accepted valuation methods.

§ accounting policies
in january 2021 250,000 treasury shares were sold in connection with the capital raise, at a price of dkk 262 per share. the disposal of 
another 677,167 treasury shares was recorded during the year in connection with stock option schemes exercised by employees, as well as 
matching of the employee share programme from 2018. the total weighted selling price in 2020/21 for the total disposal of 927,167 shares 
amounted to dkk 103m (2019/20: dkk 28m), corresponding to a weighted price of dkk 110.60 (dkk 18.10) per share. net proceeds after 
transaction costs were dkk 102m.
acquisition costs and consideration as well as the dividend on treasury shares are recognized directly in retained earnings under equity. 
proceeds from the sale of treasury shares and the issue of shares in ambu a/s in connection with the exercise of share options, and from the 
sale of employee shares or warrants are taken directly to equity.
ambu’s share capital is dkk 129m (2020: dkk 126m), divided into two classes of shares with a nominal share value of dkk 0.50. a class a 
share carries 10 votes per share, while a class b share carries one vote per share. there is no difference between the economic rights 
pertaining to the individual share classes. all shares are paid-up in full.
a total of five capital increases were carried out during 2020/21. one capital increase was intended to strengthen ambu's capital base and the 
other four took place in connection with employees' exercising of warrants. 
the total capital increase for the year consisting of 4,886,832 (2019/20: 1,007,500) class b shares has been paid at a weighted price of dkk 
254.53 (2019/20: dkk 36.52). the proceeds after transaction cost were dkk 1,225m.

in % of share capital
four times in the course of 2020/21, capital increases were effected in connection with the exercising by employees of warrants allocated in

§ accounting policies
provisions at the balance sheet date concern the deferred purchase price relating to the acquisition of technology in previous years.
provisions are recognized when the group, as a result of an event having occurred before or on the balance sheet date, has incurred a legal or 
actual liability, and it is probable that economic benefits will flow from the group in order to settle the liability. if the effect of the time value of 
money is significant, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate. when applying a discount rate, the change in provisions due to 
the timing is recognized as a financial cost.

§ accounting policies
contingent consideration as at the balance sheet date concerns outstanding liabilities relating to the acquisition of invendo in october 2017. 
for more information about the expected realisation of the liabilities and any associated uncertainties, see note 4.2. during the financial year 
ambu paid contingent consideration of dkk 298m in connection with the milestone payment concerning the acquisition of invendo.
contingent consideration is recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition by discounting expected cash flows based on contractual 
conditions and unobservable inputs, corresponding to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. adjustments to fair value are recognized in the income 
statement under net financials.
during the financial year the management remeasured the fair value of the contingent consideration based on revised expectations to the 
timing of the fda clearance. the remeasurement led to financial income of dkk 14m (2019/20: dkk 17m). the effect of a shorter discount 
period for the contingent consideration is recognised as a financial cost of dkk 24m (2019/20: dkk 65m). these remeasurements led to a 
total negative fair value adjustment of financials of dkk 10m (2019/20: dkk 48m).
the final milestone of eur 20m concerning the acquisition of invendo is expected to mature in 2021/22.

the group's incentive-based remuneration to the executive management and other levels of management personnel is described in the 
'remuneration policy' and specific information pertaining to 2020/21 is available in the 'remuneration report 2020/21' at 
www.ambu.com/remcom. the company’s board of directors does not participate in the group’s share-based payment schemes. for all 
share-based payment schemes, vesting is subject to the condition of employment during the entire vesting period. 
on 17 december 2019, the annual general meeting adopted the new long-term incentive structure of a rolling annual perfornance share 
units (psu) scheme. effective prior financial year 2019/20, all share-based payments are granted as psus that vest conditionally on one or 
more financial and strategic targets set by the board of directors. psus have a vesting period of three years. 
total share-based payment costs in the income statement 
in 2020/21, ambu established a psu program for the executive management, key employees selected on the basis of job level and 
individuals in a special reward programme. the financial target set by the board of directors was not achieved and thus all psus were 
subsequently cancelled. the grant date of the programme was january 2021, and the share price used for determining the grant date fair 
value of the psu was the average share price for the ambu a/s b share on nasdaq copenhagen in the days up to the grant, adjusted for 
expected dividend. on the time of vesting, all allocated shares, except for the ceo's, are transferred to the individuals at an exercise price of 
dkk 0. the ceo participates on equal terms and conditions except that the programmes are settled in cash upon vesting. 
in 2019/20, as part of ambu's new long-term incentive structure, ambu established a psu program for the executive management and key 
employees, excluding individuals who were already part of the stock option programme for fy2019/20 granted in 2017. the financial target 
was achieved in full and all psus were allocated. vesting is subject to ambu achieving a financial target set by the board of directors. at 
the time of vesting, all allocated shares, except for the ceo's, are transferred to the individuals at an exercise price of dkk 0. the ceo 
participates on equal terms and conditions except that the programmes are settled in cash upon vesting. 
outstanding psus have on average 1.2 years and 1.3 years until contract expiry for the executive management and 'other and former 
employees', respectively.

§ accounting policy
ambu has offered all its employees, excluding the board of directors, the opportunity to acquire a number of shares based on a fixed 
percentage of their annual base salary. the number of shares with which an employee participates is matched free of charge after two years. 
the executive management participates with 2,379 shares in the current employee share programmes currently under vesting. the total 
market value at the time of allocation in 2021 was dkk 12m (dkk 9m) at a fair value per share of dkk 235.81 at grant date (dkk 117.19). 
the fair value of ambu’s share-based payment is expensed on an accrual basis. fair value of equity-based schemes at the time of allocation 
is calculated according to recognized valuation models or methods. this value is expensed over the service period for each of the respective 
schemes and is taken to equity. on recognition of the fair value during the service period, account is taken of the number of employees who 
are expected to obtain a final right to the scheme, including the conditions to which the allocation is subject. this estimate is reassessed at 
the end of each reporting period so that only the number of rights expected to be vested are recognised. adjustments relating to previous 
periods are recognised in the period in which the adjustment is made. the fair value per unit does not change. 
performance share units that are settled in cash are taken to liabilities, instead of equity, and the fair value adjustment of the respective 
scheme end of the period is expensed to p/l. this include any changes to the quoted price of the ambu b-share on nasdaq copenhagen.

contingent liabilities
other contractual liabilities
a change-of-control clause exists in respect of committed borrowing facilities, which constitute the main part of ambu’s loan financing. 
change-of-control remuneration to members of the executive management is subject to a maximum value corresponding to two years’ 
remuneration. 
ambu’s ongoing operations and the use of ambu’s products in hospitals and clinics etc. involve a general risk of claims for damages and 
sanctions against ambu. the risk is deemed to be customary for the industry. 
ambu is involved from time to time in disputes with customers and patients about ambu’s products. appropriate provisions are made on an 
ongoing basis, and product liability insurance has been taken out. the management believes that the likely outcomes of these disputes can 
be covered by the provisions made and recognized in the balance sheet at 30 september 2021. for a more detailed description of the group’s 
risks, see the ‘risk management’ section on pages 31-32.
at the end of september 2021, ambu had entered into two significant lease contracts with commencement dates in q1 2021/22. the first 
contract relates to the new manufacturing facilty in mexico, which at the end of september 2021 was under construction. the second contract 
relates to offce space in germany. the combined value of dkk 254m will be recognised in accordance with ifrs 16 'leases' as a right-of-use 
asset and a lease liability at the end of q1 2021/22.
5.7 related parties
the group’s related parties include the company’s board of directors and executive management and members of their families. related 
parties furthermore include enterprises in which the aforementioned persons have a significant interest.
during the year, no transactions, except for payment of the management’s remuneration (notes 2.3 and 5.3), took place with the board of 
directors, executive management, major shareholders or other related parties.

independent auditor’s report 
 
to the shareholders of ambu a/s 
opinion  
we have audited the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements of ambu 
a/s for the financial year 1 october 2020 – 30 september 
2021, pages 45-85 and pages 92-104, which comprise 
income statement, statement of comprehensive income, 
balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, cash flow 
statement and notes, including accounting policies, for 
the group and the parent company. the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent company financial 
statements 
are 
prepared 
in 
accordance 
with 
international financial reporting standards as adopted 
by the eu and additional requirements of the danish 
financial statements act.   
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent company financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the financial position of the group and the 
parent company at 30 september 2021 and of the results 
of the group’s and the parent company’s operations and 
cash flows for the financial year 1 october 2020 – 30 
september 2021 in accordance with international 
financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and 
additional requirements of the danish financial 
statements act.  
our opinion is consistent with our long-form audit report 
to the audit committee and the board of directors. 
basis for opinion 
we conducted our audit in accordance with international 
standards 
on 
auditing 
(isas) 
and 
additional 
requirements applicable in denmark. our responsibilities 
under those standards and requirements are further 
described in the ‘auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of 
the consolidated financial statements and the parent 
company financial statements’ (hereinafter collectively 
referred to as ‘the financial statements’) section of our 
report. we believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. 
 
independence 
we are independent of the group in accordance with the 
international ethics standards board for accountants’ 
code of ethics for professional accountants (iesba 
code) and additional requirements applicable in 
denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these rules and 
requirements.   
 
to the best of our knowledge, we have not provided any 
prohibited non-audit services as described in article 5(1) 
of regulation (eu) no. 537/2014 
 
appointment of auditor 
we were appointed as auditor of ambu a/s on 13 
december 2017 for the 2017/18 financial year. we have 
been reappointed by resolution of the general meeting 
for a total consecutive period of four years up until the 
2019/20 financial year. 
key audit matters  
key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most significance in our 
audit of the financial statements for the 2020/21 financial 
year. these matters were addressed during our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole and in forming our 
opinion thereon. we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters. for each matter below, our description 
of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that 
context.  
 
we have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the 
‘auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements’ section, including in relation to the key audit 
matters below. accordingly, our audit included the 
design and performance of procedures to respond to our 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements. the results of our audit procedures, 
including the procedures performed to address the 
matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on 
the financial statements. 
 
recognition of revenue in the usa due to price 
adjustment structure 
in the us market, a significant portion of ambu’s sales 
flow through dealers (third-party warehouses) who sell 
the products to public and private hospitals and clinics 
(the end-customers). ambu’s sales price to the dealer 
depends on the pricing arrangement ambu has agreed 
with the end-customer. 
 
as ambu’s sales to end-customers deviate in amounts 
and timing from the amounts invoiced to the dealer, 
ambu subsequently adjusts the price stated in the 
preliminary invoice. price adjustments are recognized on 
an ongoing basis, and price adjustments which have not 
been settled at the balance sheet date are recognized as 
a reduction in trade receivables in the balance sheet.   
 
we focus on this area, as the assessment of non-settled 
price adjustments to dealers is complex and includes 
management estimates and judgements. 
 
reference is made to note 2.2 revenue to the 
consolidated financial statements.  
 
how our audit addressed the key audit matter 
we have identified, tested and assessed key internal 
controls and related systems which are used to process 
and calculate price adjustments for dealers.   
 
 
                                                                            
 
89 
 
we assessed and reviewed management’s calculation of 
price adjustments by comparing the assumptions applied 
with the group’s trading policies, the terms of existing 
contracts, third-party reported data and historical price 
adjustment levels.  
we further made an assessment of the most significant 
parameters included in the calculation of the non-settled 
price adjustments as at 30 september 2021 based on 
historical data, accounting records and the terms of 
existing contracts. 
valuation of intangible assets 
in connection with prior years’ acquisitions including the 
acquisition of invendo medical gmbh in the 2017/18 
financial year, the ambu group has recognized acquired 
technologies, trademarks and customer relations and 
acquired technologies in progress totalling dkk 731m as 
at 30 september 2021.  
the value of intangible assets is determined in 
connection with the purchase price allocation. in case of 
indications of impairment, an impairment test is 
prepared, based on management’s estimates of the 
future value based on an assessment of future cash 
flows on the basis of strategic plans, long-term growth 
and discount rate.   
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in determining 
the net present value of future cash flows, we considered 
these impairment tests to be a key audit matter.  
reference is made to note 3.2 other intangible assets to 
the consolidated financial statements. 
how our audit addressed the key audit matter 
our audit procedures included testing the mathematical 
accuracy of the discounted cash flow model and 
comparing forecasted profitability to internally approved 
budgets.  
we evaluated the assumptions and methodologies used 
in the discounted cash flow model, in particular those 
relating to the forecast revenue growth and ebit margin, 
including comparing with historical growth rates.  
further, we evaluated the sensitivity analysis on the 
assumptions applied in the valuations prepared by 
management. 
statement on the management’s 
review 
management is responsible for the management’s 
review. 
 
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the management's review, and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.  
 
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the management’s review 
and, in doing so, consider whether the management’s 
review is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit, 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.   
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the 
management’s review provides the information required 
under the danish financial statements act.   
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
the management's review is in accordance with the 
financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the danish 
financial statements act. we did not identify any 
material misstatement of the management's review. 
management’s responsibilities for the 
financial statements 
management is responsible for the preparation of 
consolidated financial statements and parent company 
financial statements that give a true and fair view in 
accordance with international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu and additional 
requirements of the danish financial statements act 
and for such internal control as management determines 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.  
in preparing the financial statements, management is 
responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
in 
preparing 
the 
financial 
statements 
unless 
management either intends to liquidate the group or the 
parent company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so. 
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance as to 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our 
opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with isas and additional 
requirements applicable in denmark will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of the financial statements. 
as part of an audit conducted in accordance with isas 
and additional requirements applicable in denmark, we 
exercise 
professional 
judgement 
and 
maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. we also: 
• 
identify 
and 
assess 
the 
risks 
of 
material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
 
 
                                                                            
 
90 
 
omissions, misrepresentations or the override of 
internal control.  
• 
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 
purpose 
of 
expressing 
an 
opinion 
on 
the 
effectiveness of the group's and the parent 
company's internal control.  
• 
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by 
management.  
• 
conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the group’s and 
the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. if we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor's report. however, future events 
or conditions may cause the group and the parent 
company to cease to continue as a going concern.  
• 
evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
contents of the financial statements, including the 
note disclosures, and whether the financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions 
and events in a manner that gives a true and fair 
view.  
• 
obtain 
sufficient 
appropriate 
audit 
evidence 
regarding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the group to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
we are responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the group audit. we remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.  
we communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.  
we also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements 
regarding 
independence, 
and 
the 
requirement to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.  
from the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent company financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the 
key audit matters. we describe these matters in our 
auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.

the group’s transfer pricing setup is based on the widely used principal model. in this model ambu a/s distributes an arm's length profit to its 
subsidiaries and any residual profit is repatriated back to ambu a/s for taxation. the taxable profit is then reduced by deductions from 
investments made. furthermore, income tax payable is reduced by ambu a/s’s tax deduction resulting from the employees’ gains from 
exercised warrants and share options. such gains are subject to personal tax.
ambu a/s received a tax refund for the year of dkk 9m (payment of dkk 3m) attributable to additional tax deduction on r&d costs in 
accordance with the danish tax assessment act and adjustments to prior years.

§ accounting policies
investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost including goodwill. if there is any indication of impairment, an impairment test is carried out. 
where the cost exceeds the recoverable amount, write-down for impairment is made to the lower value.
in the financial year 2020/21, subsidiaries distributed dkk 512m in dividends to the parent company, which reduced the net book value of the 
investments. an impairment loss of dkk 476m is therefore taken to financial expenses to reflect the lower carrying amount. reference is 
made to note 5.5 to the consolidated financial statements for an overview of the company’s subsidiaries.
