expanding into the home category

customers can shop from a confident selection of more than 250 nordic home & interior brands on boozt.com.
care-for a responsible 
e-commerce 
our care-for strategy is our roadmap to be-
coming the leading responsible e-commerce 
company in the nordics by 2025, using our 
business as a catalyst for change. achieving 
this means setting actionable goals for the next 
five years that will keep us on track to reaching 
our vision, including going climate-neutral 
across our operations and becoming the first  
b corp certified e-tailer in the nordics.

2020 highlights
successful new share issue  
and dual listing on nasdaq copenhagen.
the dual listing of the company’s shares on nasdaq copenhagen and 
public offering in denmark in connection with the listing serves the 
purpose of anchoring our position in our strongest performing market and 
improving our readiness to act on growth opportunities. we welcomed 
many new institutional and private investors. liquidity in the shares has 
increased driven by the trading on nasdaq copenhagen, but also by 
much higher trading activity on nasdaq stockholm. 
strengthening our 
capacity at the boozt 
fulfilment centre 
to facilitate growth for 2021 we further expan-
ded our automation capacity at the fulfilment 
centre with autostore phase 4 completed. 
the new fulfilment centre building of approxi-
mately 23.000 m2 was completed in 2020  
and is situated next to the existing fulfilment 
centre in Ängelholm. the building will be taken 
into operation during 2021.
strong black friday 
execution 
boozt welcomed 100,000 new customers 
during the black friday week and cyber 
monday and showed record-breaking results. 
the trends seen during the year continued with 
strong growth in the kids, sport, beauty and 
men’s categories. the successful execution 
led to upward adjustment of the full year net 
revenue outlook.
2020 highlights
from crisis to opportunity
the outbreak of the corona pandemic entailed a shift in consumer 
behaviour as the migration from offline to online accelerated. our 
initial safety measures allowed us to take control of the situation early 
on, but also to leverage this opportunity to step-change our growth 
and competitive position. through hard work we have been able to 
strengthen our market position further. we have been able to decrease 
all of our operational costs ratios through operational improvements and 
local scale leadership, while maintaining the high average order value, 
leading to improved profitability.

boozt ab / annual report 2020
“ 2020 was an outstanding year thanks to all  
of our people and the outstanding teamwork, 
long nights, long weekends, tenacity and  
the never-give-up mentality – in short grit.”
trolls and elves
being born and raised in iceland, i am probably as superstitious as most icelanders. even though 
we know it is superstition, we are raised with seeing trolls in the mountains, hearing about the 
rocks where the elves live and seeing omens in all kinds of things. so, on new year’s eve 2019  
i “jumped” into the new year saying to my wife that 2020 had a good “ring” to it. definitely better 
than 2019, which was a year that i wanted to move away from rather quickly. little did i know  
2020 would end up being the most challenging year since back in the early days of the company 
when we were fighting just to survive.

haraldsson,  
co-founder  
& ceo
11
boozt ab / annual report 2020
we made some major changes to the executive management team in 2019 with our coo and our 
cfo leaving. we replaced them with sandra gadd as cfo and lars lindgaard as csco, at the 
same time as we embarked on a “let’s clean our house” journey. having experienced hyper-growth 
for many years, it was time to “tighten the bolts”. lars and his team went through all the processes 
in the boozt fulfilment centre, changed the management of the warehouse and cleaned up our 
fulfilment operations. sandra started by expanding her team and together they started to clean 
our house in hyllie.
most of the fourth quarter in 2019 went on doing that, and it meant that when the crisis hit in 
march, we were extremely well prepared. we had more visibility into our operations and  
cost structure than ever before, and we had set up a leaner, more efficient warehouse and  
supply chain operation.
so, after the initial shock from the lockdown in march had subsided we were ready to attack. 
and we did! even though many of our people were working remotely, all our teams got together 
(virtually), stepped up to the challenge and delivered world-class performance during the rest  
of the year. 
we battled in an environment that was totally unpredictable. at first, we put everything on hold 
because nobody knew how deep the crisis would be. we secured our cash position and access 
to cash and tried to make our costs as variable as possible. for sure, sales went down initially but 
then consumers went online. this was when we realized that this was not only a challenge but that 
it could also be a huge opportunity. so we made a step change and started to hunt growth instead. 
and we grew. 2020 was an outstanding year thanks to all of our people and the outstanding 
teamwork, long nights, long weekends, tenacity and the never-give-up mentality – in short grit.
level up
when we submitted our preparation deck for the annual strategy seminar with the board  
in october, it was the most extensive we had submitted so far and probably also the best.
basically, it expressed the drive and energy that we sensed around the company. we had cleaned 
up our house. we felt more in control, we knew the details of our operations even better and  
the ambition was to demonstrate that we were well prepared for a step-change in growth.
and we are. we have welcomed more than 1 million new customers to our two shops and we want 
to make sure they come back. we have many new homegrown initiatives. we launched our own 
developed booztpay on booztlet beginning of november last year and will roll it out to boozt.com 
early q2 this year. we launched “the edit” and our high-end designers category on boozt.com, 
did a major relaunch of our home category and are in the final stages of rolling out the new and 
improved partner portal where we offer outstanding media- and marketing services to our brand 
partners on behalf of boozt media partnership. and finally, we have been much more vocal about 
our sustainability initiatives as we firmly believe that online shopping done right has the lowest 
carbon footprint if you are buying fashion and apparel (more about that later in this report).
for the first time ever, we did not have a stock problem. on the contrary. most companies would 
say that this is awesome, as you have a much lower risk for write-downs end of the season and 
your net working capital is low. for us, it was lost sales opportunities and a lack of control. we know 
that we can manage too much stock. too little stock was new to us and it felt uncomfortable. we 
were depending on the brands to deliver more items into the warehouse to be able to sell more.
we don’t like not being in control. this is why we have built our own infrastructure, why we have 
built our own platform, why we launched booztpay, and why we took over the staff in our fulfilment 
centre in Ängelholm.
letter to shareholders
letter to shareholders
12
boozt ab / annual report 2020
basically, our main message at the strategy session was that we want to raise the bar – take stock 
risk and take back control. this probably sounds crazy, but we are at our best when it is not easy. 
when we set ambitious growth targets, buy inventory to achieve those growth targets, and then 
spend the year running around working hard and thinking creatively about how to solve that stock 
problem. we will make some bad decisions and hopefully many more good decisions – but the 
main thing will be that we call the shots. we like it when it’s not easy – if it was easy, everybody 
would be doing it.
during the year we did a capital raise and a dual-listing of our shares on the copenhagen stock 
exchange – nasdaq copenhagen. we welcomed many new shareholders, and our shareholder 
base increased from approx. 5.000 at the beginning of the year to more than 15.000 at the end of 
the year. that’s good. not only because they are shareholders but also because they are probably 
also good and loyal customers.
the capital raise is intended to be used for potential acquisitions. until now we have grown 
organically – and we prefer to continue doing that – but we believe that we can accelerate even 
further if we manage to find a company in the nordics, where we can help them grow and improve 
their operations at the same time as they might help us accelerate boozt and/or booztlet.
we were asked a lot about why we also wanted to be listed in copenhagen. the short answer is 
that we are an öresund company. we are both swedish and danish (and international), we have 
the biggest investor base in denmark, with around 30% of our capital owned by danish investors. 
also, we believe that by establishing our boozt brand even stronger in denmark, we will get closer 
to becoming a household brand in denmark, further increasing loyalty from our customers.
the season is still long
some 20 years ago a good friend of mine got a gig as a football coach for a team in copenhagen 
playing in division 3 in denmark. the team had been playing “ok’ish”, with a middle-of-the-league 
position the last couple of seasons, but suddenly found themselves winning the first 5 matches in 
the new season and leading the league with my friend as the new and successful coach.
i met him and asked; “how are you? you must be doing fantastic as you are this amazing success 
with your team”. i was a bit surprised when he looked at me with a strange look on his face, 
answering; “i feel awful. my team has won the first 5 matches and they think that they are world 
champions. with that attitude it is just a matter of time before we start losing”.
he was right. they started to lose their matches….and ended the season as a mediocre team in 
the middle of the league.
the reason i am writing this is that whenever i feel a sense of success, i get concerned. jeff bezos 
from amazon talks about the day 1 mentality. always to think and act like a start-up. always think  
it is day 1. because when it is day 2, you start the decline that ultimately leads to despair.
here at boozt we talk about the “care-why”. care about the customer, care about our fellow 
boozters and care about our stakeholders. in our view, the “care-why” is the difference between the 
ordinary and the exceptional. it is the “care-why” that provides outstanding customer experience, 
and it is the “care-why” that makes the customer return.
2020 was a very good year for us. we were not only one of the fastest-growing e-commerce 
companies in our industry in europe but also one of the most profitable ones. we were good  
at turning a corona challenge into an opportunity and managed to both think and act fast  
throughout the year.
letter to shareholders
13
boozt ab / annual report 2020
therefore, it is tempting to sit back, tap yourself on the shoulder and tell yourself that you are  
the best. nordic champion…!
but we don’t. it is still “day 1” in hyllie, in Ängelholm, in copenhagen, in Århus and in vilnius.  
the pressure on us in 2020 was through an external agent (covid-19). in 2021 the pressure will 
be self-inflicted. we have a lot of exciting things going on. we have launched the home category 
with high expectations, we are going for aggressive growth in kids and sports, we want the men  
to continue buying with us, and we want the women to get back to buying occasion wear!  
and finally, we want to continue the rocket growth on booztlet.
we will work as hard as ever before, and we have set high goals. it will probably be a bit more  
fun when societies reopen and we can celebrate and party, but we are as committed to  
our ambitious targets as ever before.
 
because we care why.

what we do
we are a nordic technology company selling fashion and lifestyle. this includes 
fashion for women, men, kids, sports, beauty and home. we offer our customers 
a curated and contemporary selection of brands, relevant to a variety of lifestyles 
for the nordic customer, mainly through our multi-brand webstore boozt.com. 
the technological infrastructure of the company is own-developed and built, 
allowing for full control of the customer experience, which is key to our ability to 
achieve industry-leading customer satisfaction. we strive to offer a convenient 
shopping experience with high service levels, consistent user experiences 
across both mobile devices and desktop, quick deliveries and easy returns.
the boozt brand is a leading name for fashion in the nordics through high 
customer satisfaction. this is consistently proven by a net promoter score*  
(nps) of 70 (69), a trustpilot score of 4.6 (4.6), and a growing base of loyal 
returning customers.
boozt has grown rapidly over the last few years to reach sek 4.4 billion in  
revenue in 2020 and building a base of 2,043,000 active customers on  
boozt.com.
bzt fashion (the original name) was founded in 2007 to conduct outsourced, 
online, mono-brand operations for fashion brands. that business model failed, 
and the company was relaunched in 2011 by the five co-founders, who joined 
during 2010 and 2011. boozt.com was launched in august 2011 as a multi- 
brand webstore on an in-house purpose-built platform. in the following years, 
significant investments were made to support growth and increase the number 
of customers.

our segments
boozt.com
the boozt.com segment consists of the operational 
activities related to the multi-brand webstore boozt.com. 
boozt.com is focused on the nordic region (with nordic 
countries representing around 95 percent of visits). 
however, we serve ten geographic areas (sweden, 
denmark, norway, finland, germany, united kingdom, 
france, the netherlands, poland, and other european 
countries) and in nine languages based on a shared 
platform and common backend. boozt.com is an online 
destination for fashion and lifestyle, tailored to deliver 
convenience and a curated selection from the group’s 
over 1000 brand partners. boozt.com presents fashion 
products split into the main categories; women, men, 
kids, sports, beauty and home.
to support the convenient online shopping experience, 
boozt.com offers free and fast deliveries, free and easy 
returns, customer support and a tailormade selection 
catered to modern nordic fashion followers, with limited 
minimum order value.
booztlet.com
the booztlet.com segment consists of the operational 
activities related to booztlet.com. the booztlet.com 
segment was launched in 2015 and started as the 
group’s channel for inventory clearance, retailing items 
that did not sell within an allotted time frame. following 
strong customer activity with limited marketing, 
the scope of booztlet.com has now expanded to 
include its own inventory and we are pursuing a more 
dedicated strategy to become the leading online off-
price player in the nordics. customers shopping at 
booztlet.com are charged for deliveries and returns 
in exchange for attractive discounts. we see great 
potential in our outlet segment and going forward we  
will increase our focus further on this segment.
other
the other segment consists of the operational activities 
related to the group’s two physical booztlet retail outlets 
and the retail store beauty by boozt. the beauty by boozt 
store serves the purpose of strengthening the relationship 
with the beauty brands helping build a strong offering 
online on boozt.com. after evaluating the beauty by boozt 
physical retail operation, a decision to cease the current 
business in copenhagen was made. an exit clause in 
the lease contract of the copenhagen store has been 
exercised in april 2021. in the remaining lease period a 
booztlet store, which was opened during 2020, will be run 
out of the location as an addition to the already existing 
booztlet outlet store in taastrup. as part of our commitment 
to the beauty category a new beauty by boozt physical 
retail operation was opened in malmö, sweden, during 
2020.
from 1 january 2021, boozt is changing its segment 
reporting to agree with the internal reporting. the other 
segment containing the group’s physical stores is being 
split between the two current main segments boozt.com 
and booztlet.com, where beauty by boozt will be a part of 
boozt.com and the booztlet outlet stores will be a part of 
booztlet.com.

boozt ab / annual report 2020
a tailor-made infrastructure
at the core of what we do as a business is our 
technology. we have built one of the most advanced 
e-commerce platforms in the nordics using cutting-
edge web technologies and infrastructure components. 
this purpose-built infrastructure enables full control 
over the customer experience and ensures world-
class performance, scalability, and security. we strive 
to use technology as a tool to create a better customer 
experience and more efficient operations. our operations 
are built on the boozt integrated technology platform (the 
“solar system”) and is used by all of our business functions. 
internally we refer to this approach as the “halo” as our 
technology is central for all our organisational activities.
the success of our technology ecosystem has been made 
possible by our community of more than 100 developers. 
our teams are spread across five tech hubs in different 
geographical locations around sweden, denmark, 
poland, and lithuania, and work with a non-hierarchical, 
dynamic and international setup. a large number of boozt 
developers operate out of the company’s headquarters, 
which we see as an advantage in running a cost-efficient 
and scalable organisational structure.
established 
processes 
and 
practices 
enable 
our 
developers to work efficiently and flexibly, adapting to the 
changing needs of the business. key business functions 
(such as buying, merchandising, marketing, customer 
service, it and finance) for all geographical areas are 
provided in-house on a centralised basis. to ensure that 
new functionalities and improvements to the systems are 
aligned with existing processes, developers work in small 
cross-functional teams in direct relation to a business 
function or unit. projects are managed directly between 
the developers and the business specialists, without the 
need for project managers. we trust in our people and this 
approach allows for speed and flexibility, with a proven 
lower overhead.

strategically positioning our technology projects close to 
the business units has enabled us to develop a unique 
combination of systems ranging from the webshop, content 
and product management, warehouse management, 
customer service, financial services, apps and more. our 
in-house systems are complemented by using best-in-
class services for certain parts of the process, such as qlik 
sense (business intelligence) and salesforce (email and 
crm). in 2020 , as an evolution of our strong partnership 
with google, we have also moved all sites and services to 
google cloud infrastructure. this ensures flexibility and 
increased security, even when working remotely. 
fostering innovation 
we continued to invest in innovations and development 
that will help us stay at the forefront of the online shopping 
experience. boozt innovation lab was created in 2019, with 
a focus on strengthening our competences within the app 
and mobile web development. the team works in colla- 
boration with the business, but more autonomous than 
the other tech hubs, to ensure more progressive thinking 
and enabling us to fast-track new technology projects. 
in 2020, we also formed an internal tech council with 
the purpose of focusing on cross-system technology 
advancements. the members of the council evaluate 
and provide guidance in regards to new technologies, 
ensuring that we continue to push the boundaries of 
our existing set-up and align the development roadmap 
with business priorities. with our position as one of the 
largest technology companies in the nordics, we also 
want to make our knowledge available to the rest of the 
tech community. our boozt tech blog is a collective effort 
from our platform team, driven and directed by our writers,  
to share insights and best practices with the community 
and peers. 
our e-commerce platform  
enables us to:
• ensure full control of performance and stability 
• align the development roadmap with business 
priorities
• be less dependent on external factors
• keep us one step ahead of the competition  
on business-critical processes

data-driven customer journey optimisation
customer satisfaction is built through each touchpoint 
with the customer. ranging from when the customer 
enters the site for the first time to when they receive their 
order and all touchpoints in between such as navigation, 
filtering, check-out, and customer service. we use 
customer-generated data to constantly evaluate all these 
touchpoints as well as to improve the customer journey 
with innovative additions
in-house media expertise drives marketing  
efficiencies
acquiring new customers is key in order to outgrow the  
market. to ensure the highest possible return on our  
marketing investment we have a channel-agnostic media 
strategy. we measure the efficiency of all channels – 
both offline and online media – on an ongoing basis and 
direct the investment towards the most efficient channels.  
all media is produced and purchased in-house ensuring  
full control and the highest possible reach for the 
investments made.
boozt media partnership
boozt media partnership (bmp) enables our brand 
partners to benefit from our extensive anonymised 
customer data, creating targeted campaigns that reach, 
engage and convert audiences. all with the protection 
of customer privacy and in compliance with gdpr. the 
bmp offers an in-depth understanding of their brand  
and the customers buying their brand. how loyal are 
they? how often do they re-order from the brand?  
how big a share is full price customers? where in the 
customer lifecycle does the customer buy the brand? 
which brands create a positive synergy? the bmp 
gives answers to these questions. by making big data 
actionable, we offer advanced advertising solutions 
for our brands – all with one goal; to help our partners 
reach, engage and convert both existing customers 
and new target groups. the bmp is an area of increased 
internal focus with a great potential to strengthen  
brand relationships as well as monetise our extensive 
data on the nordic fashion customer.

leading fulfilment and distribution setup
boozt’s logistics processes include fulfilment activities 
(inbound logistics, storage, outbound logistics, and return 
handling) and distribution activities (transportation and 
shipping services). the logistics process also includes 
the handling of dangerous goods (un marked cosmetic 
products).
the boozt fulfilment centre (bfc) is located in Ängelholm, 
an hour’s drive north of the headquarter in malmö. a 
central location in the nordics with fast access to the entire 
region. the bfc is custom-built to optimise the use of the 
automation system, autostore, and can be expanded 
in a modular way when more capacity is needed. the 
automated bfc also has a photo studio with automated 
photo ramps for photographing merchandise and stations 
for taking detailed photos of e.g. shoes and jewellery.
our autostore installation is the largest in the world and 
was further expanded during 2020 with the completion 
of the fourth phase of our planned automation expansion. 
this secures our capacity for our high growth ambitions 
for 2021. during the coming year we will make room for a 
phase five and six in the current warehouse. this means 
that we will move some of the processes surrounding 
the autostore setup into the new adjacent warehouse 
building that was taken into operation at the end of 2020. 
the bfc facilities are leased by boozt under a multiyear 
lease contract.
the decision was made to insource the staff at our 
fulfilment centre with clear benefits on both performance 
and costs. the contract with the external staff provider 
was terminated in december 2019 and an agreement was 
reached with the current staff provider to take over all the 
current staff as of january 1, 2021. this step along with the 
existing fulfilment management team secured a smooth 
handover process.
boozt uses a combination of well-reputed, third-party 
distribution partners that vary by country to enable a 
fast delivery to customers. we have a flexible process 
to use different distribution partners and continue to 
integrate additional partners. orders are picked up 
multiple times throughout the day at the bfc to ensure 
fast deliveries. in order to efficiently serve our customers 
in each geographical market, boozt partners with local 
distribution partners. we have a strategy of having at least 
two distribution partners in each country in the nordics.
integrated customer service
customer satisfaction is our most important key performance 
indicator and if our customers need to get in contact, we 
strive to deliver a best-in-class customer service. our 
customer service agents are therefore an essential part of 
the organisation and we continue to set higher standards for 
response times and quality on all communication channels. 
this includes phone, email, and social media.
responsible clearance strategy
our online webshop booztlet.com and the physical 
booztlet store in copenhagen support the journey towards 
minimising inventory risk, as well as ensuring a responsible 
handling of unsold items from boozt.com. customers 
shopping on booztlet.com can buy items at a high discount. 
in exchange, customers pay for shipping and returns, thus 
covering the associated operational costs. the physical 
booztlet store is the last resort and ensures that all items 
end up with a customer.

during 2020, the overall market environment experienced a high degree of 
unpredictability and volatility, making the exact online penetration of the nordic 
market hard to pinpoint. a significant shift in consumer behavior from offline to 
online was accelerated by the corona pandemic. we estimate the total nordic 
market for apparel, shoes, beauty and home to approximately 395 billion sek 
and the online penetration to 26%. the apparel and beauty market has a higher 
online penetration at around 30% while the sport and home market are estimated 
to be below 20%. 
we observed a strong increase in demand for our sports, kids and beauty 
categories as consumers adapted to local restrictions. the demand for home 
interior products also increased during the year. as the online penetration still 
remains relatively low for this category there is potential for development of the 
underlying market to facilitate growth. we predict that the fashion apparel market 
will recover from the effects of the pandemic in the coming year and that the 
online share will continue to increase from the 2020 level.
the market
24
boozt ab / annual report 2020
drivers of online migration
the rapid growth of the online fashion and lifestyle market 
can be attributed to several factors including availability, 
selection, transparency, and convenience.
availability: consumers have increased the time spent 
online in recent years. the online environment provides 
a convenient shopping experience available at any time, 
without regard to the location of the customer or devices 
(including mobile, desktops and other mobile devices).
selection: by browsing online shops, consumers are able 
to access a relevant selection in a matter of seconds, 
providing online retailers an advantage over offline 
retailers. online retailers can optimise their selection 
based on customer preferences by utilising big data 
and algorithms to pinpoint consumer behaviour which 
provides customers with a focused and relevant offering. 
story of boozt
at the same time, brands are able to make their entire 
selections available in web stores, which in turn increases 
the probability the customer will find their desired product.
transparency: online retailers can deliver the value chain 
at a lower cost than offline retailers and these savings, 
we believe, will ultimately go back to the consumers. 
customers do not want to pay more than needed and  
with easy price comparisons, they know what the market 
price is.
convenience: the ability to order merchandise at any time 
and location, with a relevant selection of products offered 
and services provided, results in high levels of conveni-
ence for online shoppers. this is further enhanced by fast 
deliveries, easy returns, and secure payment solutions.
the importance of local scale
e-commerce, and particularly fashion e-commerce, is 
a scale business. local-scale that is. by being strong in 
the individual market, you can harvest the local scale 
advantages in areas such as distribution, fulfilment, 
marketing and media, and payment solutions.
the market rewards local scale giving significant barriers 
to entry. successful online fashion and lifestyle retailers 
must achieve sufficient scale with their platforms to create 
efficient operations. however, to achieve such scale, 
sufficient order volume is required. with sufficient scale, 
supported by customers’ purchase frequency, attractive 
unit economics can be achieved for returning customers.
boozt aims to be the leader in the online fashion and 
lifestyle industry in the nordics. to achieve this goal, we 
plan to leverage our local scale which generates a strong 
network effect which in turn improves our brand recognition 
and relevance for both customers and business partners. 
in addition, we will profit from attractive unit economics 
mainly due to a high, above industry average order value. 
this allows for a high absolute profit per order as fulfilment 
and distribution costs are relatively fixed on a per order 
basis, regardless of order value.
online penetration in the nordics
the growth of the online fashion and lifestyle market is 
positively influenced by the ongoing general shift from 
traditional offline to online shopping and was fuelled further 
in 2020 by the corona pandemic. we predict a continued 
high online penetration as well as a strengthening of the 
underlying fashion and lifestyle market once societies 
reopen. fashion is still a category well suited for online 
sales, due to the high frequency of shopping and the 
attractive unit economics of scale this category can offer. 
we expect the online market growth to continue, with 
more and more customers migrating from offline to online 
shopping. the corona pandemic is also more permanently 
shifting the consumers towards online shopping which is 
accelerating the structural growth towards online in the 
nordics. local scale is a key element for profitability in 
online fashion and we intend to continue investing in an 
even stronger customer experience over the coming 
years to drive further market share gains and best-in-class 
growth rates, maximizing the value of the company when 
online growth slows. 
25
boozt ab / annual report 2020
areas that are affected by local scale:
brand partnerships: the most in-demand brands within 
each corresponding segment are able to attract customers 
and strengthen the retailers’ attractiveness. brands, in turn, 
generally put high demands on their suppliers and may be 
reluctant to take risks that can harm their brand equity, for 
instance through associations with unproven or sub-scale 
online retailers.
fulfilment and distribution: fulfilment and distribution 
costs are one of the largest cost items for online retailers, 
in addition to the costs of goods sold. these costs are 
generally improved by local scale, providing lower 
fulfilment cost per order and better terms with distribution 
partners. one of the key challenges for online fashion 
and lifestyle retailers is effectively handling the volume of 
products resulting from customer returns. simultaneously, 
an easy return process is valuable to sustain customer 
satisfaction and to reduce perceived purchase risk, 
making return management a substantial entry barrier for 
new potential entrants.
marketing and customer insight: efficiency in acquiring 
new customers is affected by scale, for example, the ability 
to reach attractive agreements with media providers. 
the scale also allows for investments in resources to 
systematically use, analyse and monitor customer data 
for allocation of resources to those channels that show 
favourable return on investment.
the technology platform and efficiency of operations:
as consumers place emphasis on the overall shopping  
experience, scale further enables online retailers to invest 
in new features to drive traffic and increase the time 
consumers spend in their webstores. the swiftness and 
efficiency of a webstore displaying relevant content and 
proper utilisation of customer data can positively impact 
the number of orders, the average order value, and 
customer engagement. strong operational infrastructure 
and execution, supported by the wide usage of technology 
in various business processes, enable efficient operations 
and increase the ability to offer a competitive customer 
experience.

nordic online leadership through best-in-class 
customer satisfaction
we strive to offer nordic consumers the best online 
shopping experience, with a carefully curated selection 
of almost 700 mid-to premium fashion/apparel brands,  
260 beauty brands, 250 home brands and industry-
leading delivery times. our customer focus has resulted in 
a strong net promoter score of 70 on boozt.com.
we offer a complementary assortment of fashion and 
lifestyle categories including clothing, shoes, accessories, 
sports, beauty, and home. instead of searching for specific 
brands, most of our customers prefer to browse and mix 
and match different garments and products. resulting 
from strong relationships with the brands, boozt offers 
a combination of local and international brands, existing 
and new, that are relevant for nordic customers.
boozt.com targets the mid-to-premium segment of the 
nordic market, while booztlet.com is focusing on the price-
conscious consumers shopping at lower price points as 
well as the bargain hunting segment. with the accelerating 
focus and momentum on booztlet.com we increasingly 
have a relevant offering to most of the nordic market. 
this strategy of having two distinct brands also serves 
as a hedge in periods of economic uncertainty where 
customers on average trade down, allowing us to capture 
the growth at risk on boozt.com and booztlet.com.
we categorise our brand partners into three categories: 
premium brands, mid-market brands, and entry brands, 
where we mainly focus on mid-market and premium 
brands representing more than 90% of our selection. 
premium and mid-market brands carry a higher average 
item price and hence contribute to a higher average order 
value. entry brands also have considerably shorter sales 
periods compared to premium brands. we have a strong 
focus on building the premium brand equity of boozt.com 
to offer our brands a platform where they can build brand 
equity towards the nordic consumer. the designer shop 
was launched in 2020 on boozt.com, creating a unique 
premium shop-in-shop experience tailored to the nordic 
customer. the design of the new shop caters to customers 
that want to buy premium brands in an online environment 
with a premium boutique feel, supported by a best- 
in-class customer experience.
growth strategy 
story of boozt
27
boozt ab / annual report 2020
staying relevant to our customers
since the start, we have believed in building a strong 
nordic brand. our core customer group is women and 
men between 25 and 54 years old. they are typically in 
a relationship, have kids, well-educated and tend to have 
an above-average income. in 2020, our qualified brand 
awareness within this segment was 44% across the nordics.
rather than expanding our geographical market, we 
believe in expanding within our existing market position 
in the nordic region. this also enables us to capitalise on 
the growing nordic online fashion market by maintaining 
our distinct market position based on a curated fashion 
and lifestyle selection geared towards nordic tastes. 
for boozt.com with a focus on mid-market and premium 
brands and on booztlet.com with a focus on lower 
price points and the off-price market. we leverage our 
strong relationships with the brands to purchase excess 
inventory for booztlet.com at high discounts that we can 
then transfer to the customers. we believe this strong 
position will enable us to take advantage of a significant 
market opportunity for online fashion and lifestyle retail.
we will continue to increase our awareness in the part of 
the nordics where there is lower awareness, so as to fur-
ther fulfil our ambition for boozt to become a household 
name in each of the nordic markets. thus, we will continue 
investing in both online- and offline campaigns to increase 
brand awareness and familiarity while focusing specifical-
ly on the underrepresented regions and customer groups.
it is crucial to stay relevant. by continuing to provide 
a curated selection in the mid- to premium segment 
on boozt.com, we believe we can maintain relevance 
with our nordic audience. more than half of our sales 
are generated through local nordic brands and we 
continuously develop our brand mix to ensure we offer the 
brands our customers desire. in 2020, we launched the 
home category on boozt.com with the ambition to offer 
our customers the full range of the best and most relevant 
home brands, covering all rooms in the house. the focus 
is on nordic mid- to premium priced home & interior 
brands, with more than 250 brands already signed. the 
expansion into home is a significant step towards creating 
the department store experience online.

personalisation is important, but we want the customer to 
be in control of the personalisation. in other words, we 
provide options for the customer on how to personalise, 
but it is the customer who decides where and when to 
use it. we are constantly improving the personalisation 
options on our webstores, developing search, sorting and 
filtering options as well as improving descriptions and the 
inspirational journey where relevant. an example is our 
size recommendation algorithm where the use of big data 
and machine learning which enables the customer to get a 
size recommendation in categories with no prior purchase 
history. by looking at the customers previous purchases 
in other categories, you can find similar customers who 
have also purchased in the new category to produce a 
size recommendation.
in the e-commerce business, ease and speed are of abso-
lute importance. the customer experience should be fast, 
seamless and platform-agnostic enabling the customer to 
start a shopping session by browsing on a mobile. if they 
then wish, they can continue with the actual purchase on 
a desktop. should the customer need assistance from our 
customer service, it is essential that the customer service 
next day
1-2 days
be both fast and accurate. we are constantly working with 
improvements to our customer service. as a testament of 
our efforts, customer satisfaction, which we measure on 
a daily basis through net promoter score and trustpilot, 
continues to be at industry-leading levels.
convenience, fast delivery and return options are key. 
we aim for a standard delivery time of 1-2 days, offered to 
approximately 99% of our customers, ensuring a leading 
delivery proposition. we continue to focus on increasing the 
number of customers who receive their order the next day.
returns must be convenient in order to satisfy our 
customers. most of our customers reuse the bags that 
the goods arrived in as packaging for returns, which we 
encourage since it is resource-efficient. a return label 
and return form is automatically included with each 
order. requiring no further additional action, the return 
process is very convenient for the customer who normally 
receives their return payment within days of sending the 
item(s) back. 
local anchoring is key to minimise the footprint of an 
e-commerce business. this goes especially for fashion 
with the high return rates. having a fulfilment centre 
located close to the customer and ideally in only one 
location to avoid intra-company shipments is instrumental 
for a low environmental impact. 
being a strong partner for our brands
by choosing to work with boozt, brand partners gain 
access to a highly attractive customer segment on the 
nordic market via a single, reputable partner. with the 
purpose to improve efficiency when interacting with 
partners, we introduced the partner portal in 2016, which 
we have since developed further. the majority of our 
brand partners are using the portal as the primary tool to 
exchange information with boozt.
consumer behaviour is changing at a rapid pace and 
relevance is key. knowing your target group’s needs and 
demands are essential and also complex. for fashion and 
lifestyle brands, this proves especially difficult as these

companies often lack resources and skills to succeed 
in the online world. as a true online-first player, boozt 
has in-depth knowledge from analysing and predicting 
consumer behaviour. due to our size within the nordic 
mid-to-premium market, we have second-to-none data 
in this segment allowing us to create unique insights for 
our brand partners they benefit from this knowledge as 
we use it to deliver successful campaigns and product 
launches through boozt media partnership strengthening 
our brand partners position in the market. this is an area 
of increasing focus and we are developing new tools to 
further increase our relevance to our brands. 
benefiting from efficient operations and logistics
our custom-built boozt fulfilment centre (bfc) is an 
investment that will facilitate our long-term expansion 
as it operationally supports our future growth. the bfc 
operates with an automated storage and retrieval system 
called autostore and the first module was installed from  
the beginning. with autostore, we have been able to  
create a more efficient picking process while reducing  
costs. the autostore system allows for a modular  
expansion which yields good flexibility and enables 
expanding capacity in-line with increased order volumes. 
we have planned for six-module expansions, with the fourth 
expansion having been completed in 2020 . to make space 
for the remaining modules that are planned for the coming 
year, some of the bfc processes will move into the new 
adjacent warehouse building that was completed in the end 
of 2020 and will be taken into operation in 2021. to further 
yield benefits on both performance and costs the staffing of 
the bfc was insourced starting january 1, 2021.

business performance
key performance indicators 
looking at the key performance indicators related to 
customers on boozt.com, we have had another strong 
year with solid progress.
our most important kpi, customer satisfaction, main-
tained a high level during 2020. we ended the year with 
a 4.6 (4.6) score on trustpilot and a net promoter score 
of 70 (69), which is a highly satisfying level. our analy-
sis shows that customer satisfaction correlates well with 
frequency meaning that high customer satisfaction is a 
prerequisite for our customers to keep coming back.
the number of site visits in boozt.com numbers increased 
16% compared to 2019, while the conversion rate increased 
to 2.99%. this led to a 19.9% increase in the number of 
orders totalling 4,696,000 for the year. active customers, 
which are defined as customers who at least shopped 
once during 2020, increased 18% to 1,606,000 and the 
number of orders per active customer decreased to 2.30.
another very important kpi is the true frequency, which 
is defined as the order frequency for customers that have 
been with boozt.com during the last 12 months. it measures 
the order frequency in 2020 for the customer cohort who 
shopped on boozt.com during q4 2019. the idea is to 
measure the order frequency without an impact from new 
customers as they would not have had the opportunity to 
order throughout the 12 months of 2020, hence dragging 
down the order frequency. true frequency in 2020 ended 
at 6.0 compared to 6.7 the year earlier. the decrease 
can be explained by the implementation of the “fair use” 
policy in november 2019, prohibiting a group of high-
frequency shoppers, with an abnormal return behavior, 
from ordering with us. excluding the “fair use” customers, 
who had a very high frequency, the true frequency was 
unchanged compared to last year. this high level of true 
frequency shows us that we have a relevant offering for 
our loyal customers. the all-important average order 
story of boozt
value was unchanged at sek 811 (808). a change in sales 
mix towards kids, sports and beauty which has a lower 
average price compared to occasion wear categories 
such as women’s dresses affected the gross average 
order value negatively but was offset by a lower return 
rate. currency effects also impacted the average order 
value negatively with approximately 3 percentage points. 
going forward we believe that the average order value 
will remain at the sek 800 level.
financials
net sales 
net revenue increased with 27.3% to sek 4,359.3 million 
(3,424.9). currency had a negative impact on net revenue 
growth of around 2.5 percentage points and relates main-
ly to the weakening of nok compared to sek. excluding 
the change to a consignment-like agreement with a large 
brand partner effective from october 1, 2019 and the intro-
duction of a ‘fair use’ policy in november 2019, combined 
with the impact from currency the net revenue growth 
would have been around 4.5 percentage points higher.
the increase in net revenue is attributed to the boozt.com  
and booztlet.com segments with a growth of 19.8% 
(18.5%) and 127% (133%) respectively. from the spring and 
throughout the year, the group experienced a tailwind 
from the acceleration in online shopping, fuelled by the 
corona pandemic. prerequisite measures taken in the 
beginning of the corona pandemic outbreak allowed the 
group to focus solely on the in-season goods on boozt.
com reaching a very strong sell-through and thus freeing 
up capacity and enabling the extensive buying of excess 
inventory from the group’s brand partners.
the strong sell-through during the spring and summer 
months led to a limited stock availability of some high 
performing styles caused by covid-19 related delays in 
the supply-chain, which was partly compensated by an 
unusual high share of campaign goods throughout the 
second half of the year.

boozt ab / annual report 2020
other net revenue increased to sek 61.7 million (45.9) in 
2020 driven by higher marketing income from the boozt 
media partnership.
net revenue in the nordics increased by 28.2 % driven by 
sweden and denmark. growth in norway was negatively 
impacted by the depreciation of the nok. the increase in 
rest of europe was 16.6%, driven by booztlet’s expansion 
into new markets.
gross-profit 
for the full-year gross profit increased with 30.0% to sek 
1,769.4 million (1,361.0). the gross margin increased 0.9 
percentage point to 40.6% (39.7%). the increased gross 
margin was mainly driven by a higher share of campaign 
goods, which are items bought in-season at lower prices, 
following the unusually high sell-through seen throughout 
the year fuelled by consumer spending changing towards 
online driven by the corona pandemic. this was partly 
offset by a decreased income from risk sharing agreement 
with brand partners due to a change in the agreement 
structure. during 2020 this income has been recognized 
in the end-of-season sales, meaning it will to a higher 
degree impact the first quarter 2021 positively.
adjusted ebit 
adjusted ebit amounted to sek 290.3 million (109.0) for 
the year. the adjusted ebit margin increased with 3.5 
percentage points to 6.7% (3.2%) driven by higher gross 
margin from the expected temporary effects from the 
unusual high share of campaign goods, as well as the 
improvement in all the operating cost ratios, especially the 
fulfilment cost ratio. during q4 the group made a write-
down of a part of the norwegian customs receivable. 
the write-down is caused by a change in the process 
for claiming refund of customs for returns from norway at 
the norwegian tax authority. for precautionary reasons, 
a write-down of approximately sek 12 million has been 
made for a part of the customs receivable belonging to 
2019. the company still insists on its right to the claims 
towards the norwegian tax authority for this customs 
receivable. the group also issued an extraordinary staff 
bonus of sek 10 million (sek 20,000 to all employees).
ebit 
the adjustments for the year amounts to sek 108 million 
(17.2). the adjustments consist of one-off costs of sek 
36.6 million from the closing of the loss-making beauty by 
boozt store in copenhagen. the one-off costs from the 
closing consist of a write-down of the lease asset of sek 
25.7 million and other costs of sek 10.9 million related to 
write-down of fixtures and inventory as well as terminated 
staff. the adjustment also consists of share-based 
payments related to the group’s long-term incentive 
programs of sek 64.0 million (12.4) and listing costs of sek 
7.5 million due to a dual listing of the parent company’s 
share on nasdaq copenhagen.
ebit increased to sek 182.3 million (91.8) for the full year, 
while the ebit margin increased 1.5 percentage points to 
4.2% (2.7%).
net working capital 
the group realised a net working capital of sek 73.8 
million (435.3) equivalent to 1.7% (12.7%) of the net revenue 
for the last twelve months. the decrease to 1.7% was 
primarily driven by a higher increase of accounts payable 
compared to inventory, which is a consequence of a 
higher sell-through of the autumn/winter 2020 items 
compared to last year and a higher share of campaign 
stock to keep up the stock level. as campaign stock are 
bought at a high discount during the season, they have a 
positive impact on both inventory and accounts payables, 
due to the faster turnover for campaign stock. a lower 
return rate also has a positive impact as it decreases the 
inventory. compared to last year the prepaid expenses and 
accounts receivable has decreased since the invoicing 
of boozt media partnership has been made earlier this 
year compared to last year and the reversed norwegian 
customs receivable has decreased to approximately sek  
19 million at year-end (54).
cash-flow 
cash flow for the full year amounted to sek 1,375.9 million 
(-28.8). the improved cash flow was driven by improved 
cash flow from operating activities after changes in net 
working capital of sek 747.3 million (76.5) and the new 
share issue in connection with the dual listing on nasdaq 
copenhagen, where the group obtained sek 825.6 
story of boozt

million before deduction of issue costs of sek -30.7 
million. the cash flow was negatively impacted by cash 
flow from investing activities of sek -150.8 million (-171.3), 
driven by expansion of warehouse automation and 
capitalized development costs attributable to the group’s 
web platforms.
segments
boozt.com
net revenue increased with 19.8% to sek 3,773.9 million 
(3,150.7) for the year. positively affecting net revenue growth 
was lower returns due to a different sales mix with relatively 
stronger growth in men, kids, sport and beauty, which all 
have a lower return rate than women’s fashion. the net 
revenue growth was negatively impacted by currency effects 
from the depreciation of nok and dkk compared to sek. 
despite an overall declining demand for fashion and apparel 
net revenue grew strongly driven by relevant offers to the 
customers, a continued high investment in new customers 
as well as higher online penetration fuelled by the corona 
pandemic. the corona pandemic is also more permanently 
shifting the consumers towards online shopping which is 
accelerating the structural growth towards online in the 
nordics. the growth in nordic countries increased with 
20.5 % to sek 3,498.7 million (2,903.8) and rest of europe 
increased with 11.5 % to sek 275.2 million (246.9).
for the year adjusted ebit increased to sek 246.9 million 
(98.0), while the adjusted ebit margin increased to 6.5% 
(3.1%). the adjustment relates to a negative impact of 
sek 56.2 million (11.4) from share-based payments for the 
group’s long-term incentive programs and listing costs 
related to the dual listing of the company’s share on 
nasdaq copenhagen of sek 6.7 million.
for the full year ebit increased to sek 184.0 million (86.6), 
while the ebit margin increased to 4.9% (2.7%).
booztlet.com
net revenue increased with 127% to sek 560.2 million 
(246.5). the acceleration in growth was driven by higher 
awareness of booztlet.com due to increased exposure 
both online and offline. a continuously improving and 
increasing stock composition supported the strong 
growth trajectory as well as expansion of markets. all the 
nordic countries had a strong growth contributing to the 
nordic growth of 131% to sek 525 million (227.2). rest of 
europe experienced a growth of 82.5% to sek 35.2 million 
(19.3) as booztlet expanded into new markets.
adjusted ebit increased to sek 51.5 million (26.6), while 
the adjusted ebit margin decreased to 9.2% (10.8%). 
the decrease in the adjusted ebit margin was driven 
by the extraordinary stock write-down made in the first 
quarter. the write-down of sek 17 million was only partly 
recouped during the year. a higher marketing cost ratio 
also contributed to a decreased adjusted ebit. the 
adjustment relates to a negative impact of sek 7.7 million 
(1.0) from share-based payments related to the group’s 
long-term incentive programs and listing costs of sek 0.8 
million related to the dual listing of the company’s share 
on nasdaq copenhagen allocated to booztlet.
for the full year ebit increased to sek 43.0 million (25.6), 
while the ebit margin decreased to 7.7% (10.4%).
other
net revenue decreased with -9.1% to sek 25.2 million 
(27.7). the decrease was driven by the danish stores 
being closed during the spring and in the end of the year 
due to covid-19 restrictions which was partly offset by 
the opening of a new beauty by boozt store in malmö. 
adjusted ebit was improved to sek -8.1 million (-15.6) 
which was driven by a positive development in the stores 
as well as closing of the loss-making beauty by boozt 
store in copenhagen. negatively impacting adjusted 
ebit is the revaluation of the lease contract for the beauty 
by boozt store in copenhagen to include an 18-months 
penalty fee for using the exit-clause, which was done in 
the first quarter. the adjustment consists of one-off costs 
of sek 36.6 million related to the termination of the beauty 
by boozt store in copenhagen. the one-off cost for the 
closure consists of a write-down of sek 25.7 million on the 
lease asset, which relates to future leasing costs for the 
outstanding lease period ending in april 2022, after using 
the exit clause in april 2021. the other part relates to one-
off costs associated with the closure such as writedown of 
fixtures and inventory as well as terminated staff. ebit for 
the year decreased to sek -44.7 million (-20.5).

it has been a year full of unknowns. at the same time, this year has proven the strength in 
the care-why culture that is so instrumental to our company. i have seen how our people 
have gone above and beyond for our customers, the company, and each other. with a lot of 
determination and teamwork we have turned challenges into opportunities. 
throughout the year we have continued to drive our sustainability agenda forward and 
it has been rewarding to see the positive effects of our efforts. our investments into our 
local environmentally optimised fulfilment centre, running on 100% renewable energy, 
means we are able to maintain an industry-leading low 300g co2 distribution emission per 
order including returns. furthermore, we have set responsible practices within our industry  
by eliminating extreme return behaviour with our fair-use policy. as a result, we have 
lowered our total carbon emissions for the year by an amount equivalent to 25% of the 
returns co2 footprint. 
our leading position and technology present a unique opportunity to push for a more 
sustainable industry. we want to accelerate our sustainability initiatives further and with this 
report, we are launching our care-for strategy. this is our roadmap to becoming the leading 
responsible e-commerce company in the nordics by 2025. 
we want our customers to shop with us knowing they support a responsible company that 
takes real action towards contributing to a more sustainable future. as part of our care-for 
strategy we have set actionable goals for the next five years that will keep us on track to 
reaching our vision and will concentrate our efforts on areas where we can have the most 
significant impact. not only are we setting high goals for improving our own operations but 
we are also committing to partnering with organizations that are working towards improving 
environmental and social performance, such as the sustainable apparel coalition and  
higg co, and the b corp movement.
we run our business on responsible choices. although we have minimized the impact of 
our own operations, lasting change will only be achieved through collaboration across the 
entire value chain. caring for the change we want to see, we are committed to supporting our 
brand partners on their sustainability journey, making it easier for our customers to find and 
choose sustainable styles, and developing best-practices through strategic partnerships. 
when online shopping is done right it makes sustainable choices easier.

sustainability report
the fashion supply chain is complex, interlinking many 
different stakeholders across the product life-cycle. using 
our market-leading position and strong relationships 
with customers and partners we can accelerate positive 
change across the whole supply chain through enabling 
collaboration, innovation and transparency. as a retailer 
without any own production, we do not have a direct 
impact on the production of the products we sell, but we 
do have the opportunity to have a large impact as the link 
between brands and the consumer. 
as our business evolves so does our role in the supply 
chain. new technology and tools help us better collect 
and trace data, stronger partnerships create opportuni-
ties to innovate, and new business areas mean we can 
have an indirect impact on a wider supply chain. at the 
same time, external factors play a huge role in shaping  
the supply chain and constantly present new challenges. 
this makes it even more important for us to have an open 
dialogue with our partners, our customers and the industry. 
to achieve meaningful and lasting change we want to 
bring our partners along on our sustainability journey; 
proactively informing, innovating, and communicating 
best-practices with them. this is why we continuously work 
to ensure that our partners understand and embrace our 
high environmental and social standards and sustainability 
commitments. by collaborating we can better understand 
where our influence will have the strongest impact and 
how to drive transformation.

the ramifications of the e-commerce model 
as with all decisions we make throughout our business we want our sustainability efforts to be based on credible 
data, this includes correct and comprehensive information about the ramifications of the e-commerce model on the 
environment. while we will always strive to lower the footprint of our operations, the true environmental impact of  
the e-commerce model next to the brick and mortar shop is still hard to pinpoint and greater data should be  
collected and compared. we will use our positioning in the nordic market to partner with researchers that can  
help provide a better understanding of this topic based on empirical findings. 
research from the 2019 report “environmental assessment of swedish clothing consumption” by rise (research 
institutes of sweden) shows the impact of the transportation of the customer back and forth from the physical  
store. when we compare this data with the impact of our e-commerce model, the carbon footprint is significantly 
lower than when shopping in a physical store in sweden.

our value chain outlines our three main business 
segments and the flow of products within the boozt 
ecosystem. this is where we have a direct impact on  
our footprint and can ensure that we are running a 
responsible and efficient business; one that leads by 
example to inspire progress throughout the greater supply 
chain. 
our strategy is to offer a large curated selection of mid to 
premium brands with a strong focus on quality products 
that are made to last. we extend the products´ life cycle 
across our platforms, working to ensure that all items 
ultimately end up with our customers and that we minimize 
waste. this means products have multiple chances to sell, 
both initially online and then offline. any items that cannot 
be sold are ultimately donated.
our value chain enables us to make responsible choices 
in the way we handle our inventory and claims. excess 
stock from boozt.com is given a new opportunity to sell on 
booztlet.com and items with minor defects are being sold 
at high discounts in our physical booztlet stores. we also 
partner with brands to support their inventory clearance 
which we purchase at discounted prices. this enables our 
brands to use our platforms as a responsible alternative 
for handling excess inventory.

materiality assessment
based on our yearly materiality analysis, this report 
focuses on the most important sustainability issues for 
our business and includes the economic, social and 
environmental topics we have prioritised. we take into 
account a combination of external and internal factors 
when considering whether a topic is material. among 
other things, we have aligned with the overall mission 
and competitive strategy of boozt, broader societal 
expectations and the business’s influence on upstream 
entities, such as suppliers, and downstream entities such 
as customers. our assessment also takes into account 
international and local standards and agreements the 
company is committed to. 
in 2020 we conducted our materiality assessment using 
two complementary assessment tools; the sdg action 
manager and b impact assessment tool. 
sdg action manager
the sdg action manager is a tool developed by b lab, the 
legal entity behind the b corp certification and the united 
nations global compact along with advisors such as the 
danish institute of human rights, gri and the undp. 
we have adopted the sdg action manager as an internal 
management tool to help us self-assess and improve. 
with it we identified the focus areas where we can make 
the biggest difference: optimising our local operations, 
empowering our employees, engaging our partners, and 
curating our sustainable selection. this has served as 
our blueprint for adopting the sustainable development 
goals (sdgs) while we feel many of the sdgs include 
important bearings for supporting our contribution to 
sustainable development, the most relevant development 
goals we have chosen to address are sdgs 9, 12 and 17. 
goal 9. build resilient 
infrastructure, promote inclusive 
and sustainable industrialisation 
and foster innovation
goal 12. ensure sustainable 
consumption and production 
patterns.
goal 17. strengthen the means 
of implementation and revitalize 
the global partnership for 
sustainable development.
we aim to address  
the following sdgs:
the b impact assessment
the b impact assessment (bia) is a comprehensive 
management tool developed by b lab and un global 
compact that assesses a company’s performance against 
the highest standards in terms of environmental, social 
and governance performance. it focuses on operational 
impact i.e. how a company manages the day to day impact 
of running their business and the impact of their business 
model, i.e the design of the company that creates a 
specific positive benefit/outcome. completing the bia is 
the first step to becoming a certified b corporation.

our vision & strategy
our vision is to use our local nordic position and our technology platforms to make sustainable choices easy for our customers  
and our partners. by taking responsibility for our direct and indirect footprint on the value chain, and empowering people  
to act consciously, we strive to build a more sustainable future for fashion.
we are dedicated to delivering a great shopping experi-
ence to our customers, through high-tech solutions and 
a curated selection of fashion and lifestyle brands. in this 
pursuit, sustainability is a crucial building block for our 
long-term business success, ensuring that we meet the 
needs of our customers and the industry. our aspiration is 
that our actions will always reflect our desire to do good. 
with the help of a clear vision and open communication, 
we intend to amplify our efforts and share best practices 
that can influence a more sustainable industry.
our responsibility vision is very much aligned with who 
we are as a business and our well-established tradition of 
always striving to make fair and responsible decisions. we 
recognise the need to address the social and environmental 
challenges within the fashion industry, and that emphasis 
must be on taking responsibility for our direct and indirect 
impact. with the influence we have as a leading player on 
the market, we can push for a more sustainable industry 
by setting leading standards for responsible practices. 
collaborating with industry peers to improve quality and 
transparency in the supply chain, including respect for 
human rights, fair labour conditions, as well as reducing 
the environmental impact from production and operations.
to help guide us on our journey, we have concentrated 
our sustainability efforts around what we call our care-for 
strategy. the strategy is anchored in the boozt ‘care-why’ 
culture and means going beyond just knowing. we care why 
things are the way they are, care for the change we want to 
see and choose to act. this mindset is also what enables us 
to lead the progress towards a more responsible industry.

boozt ab / annual report 2020
we have structured the care-for strategy around four  
focus areas identified through our materiality analysis: our 
house, our people, our partners, and our selection. by 
making responsible choices in all these areas of our business, 
we can reduce the direct footprint of our operations, while 
also engaging our partners, our customer and our people 
on the journey to becoming a more sustainable industry.
goals & commitments 
with the challenges we as an industry face, especially with 
the effects of this unprecedented year, it has become even 
more apparent that collaborative action is key to finding 
scalable solutions to the many pressing issues throughout 
the supply chain. our care-for strategy is our roadmap to 
becoming the leading responsible e-commerce company 
in the nordics by 2025, using our business as a catalyst 
for change. the foundation of our strategy is built upon 
our commitments which are the result of our sustainability 
efforts over the years. these commitments have become 
integral to how we strive to run our business and where we 
continue to invest time and resources. 
still, we want to push further to accelerate the transition 
towards a more sustainable fashion industry. caring for the 
change we want to see in the industry, we recognize that 
we are in a position to go beyond and set higher standards 
for responsible practices. achieving this means setting 
actionable goals for the next five years that will keep us 
on track to reaching our vision. our goals cover all four

becoming a b corp certified e-tailer
by 2023 our goal is to become the first b corp certified e-tailer in the nordics.  
this means joining a global community of companies across industries focused  
on using their business as a force for good, balancing profit and purpose.
the b corp certification is issued by the nonprofit organization b lab led by 
business investors and attorneys to create a comprehensive set of legal and 
performance requirements. it is the only certification that measures the entire 
social and environmental performance of a company and includes having to  
meet requirements in three areas; verified social and environmental performance, 
legal accountability and public transparency. 
to meet these requirements, boozt must earn the verified score of 80 points 
or above on the b impact assessment, the tool that measures the company’s  
overall impact on its workers, community, customers and the environment.  
b corp certification is a highly selective status. companies must document  
their positive impact to qualify and undergo verification every three years to 
maintain their certification.
this year we are starting the journey with a self-assessment to measure  
our current score and identify areas that we will need to focus on to become 
certified. we believe the process of certification and the interaction with  
the b corp movement will help us scale our positive impact through the  
boozt business model.

reporting requirements
making responsible choices that have a positive impact on 
the industry requires a solid foundation in science-based 
research, strong partnerships and a clear understanding of 
where we can make the greatest impact. with this report, 
we use the global reporting initiative (gri) as a reporting 
guideline to improve the quality of our sustainability 
reporting. we believe the gri standards provide a solid 
framework for analysing and focusing our sustainability 
efforts.
in 2018, we became a signatory of the un global 
compact. with this commitment, we set the intention of 
adopting and adapting innovative ways to integrate the 
ten principles to establish a more sustainable business. 
this means operating in such a way as to promote and 
respect human rights and fair labour conditions, engage in 
the development of environmentally friendly technologies 
and prevent corruption in all forms. it also includes taking 
action to deliver on the sustainable development goals 
(sdgs) and we are committed to aligning our business 
goals with them. this has been the focus of our 2020 
sustainability initiatives and this report serves as our 
communication on progress (cop).
managing sustainability
we are committed to conducting our business responsibly, 
with the highest possible standards of ethics, openness, 
and transparency to build trust with our stakeholders and 
establish accountability. the strategic responsibility for our 
sustainability strategy lies with management which is then 
implemented by our sustainability team. through close 
collaboration between the sustainability team and other 
departments across the boozt group, we work together to 
execute our sustainability efforts. continuously reviewing 
our materiality analysis helps us to ensure that we act in an 
economically, socially and environmentally responsible 
way in all areas of business.
the greatest assets in our sustainability effort are 
our people. a strong company culture, based on the 
values of trust, freedom, and responsibility, reinforced 
with intelligent investments, enables our people to 
contribute positively to the environment, the business 
and the community. by offering continuous training 
and professional opportunities, we want to provide 
opportunities for our employees to utilise their knowledge, 
passion, and skills to imagine new sustainable solutions 
and contribute to our vision

we want to provide the best possible customer experience while conducting our operations in an economically,  
socially and environmentally responsible way. we are taking responsibility for the footprint of our operations.

be climate-neutral across 
our operations, including 
the impact of delivery  
and returns.
at the core of everything we do is our house. our house 
encompasses all parts of our business and enables us 
to deliver an outstanding shopping experience to our 
customers. as this is where we have the most direct impact 
on our footprint, it is essential we find smarter product 
flows in our operations. smarter product flows are best 
articulated through the use and discovery of processes 
within our daily operations which are more effective, 
efficient and sustainable. for example, shortening 
processing times for customer orders, utilising renewable 
energy, finding the optimal solution for our shipping bags 
and lowering co2 emissions. in this endeavour being 
innovative is essential to us, staying at the forefront of 
cutting-edge technology that can help transform our 
business and the industry for a sustainable future. 
as a nordic company with a leading position in the market, 
we believe that much of our success lies in keeping our 
operations local, allowing for optimised deliveries to 
customers, strong brand networks and engagement 
with our local community. our investments to handle 
all shipments and returns in our local fulfilment centre 
in Ängelholm, sweden has also contributed to more 
environmentally-friendly delivery patterns. it enables us 
to keep the carbon emissions per distributed order at an 
industry-low 0.3 kg co2e. 
impact management 
carbon emissions 
we work continuously to optimise our operations and 
improve efficiency and have created a comprehensive 
overview of our business through data collection allowing 
us to better understand where to focus our responsibility 
efforts. in 2020 we improved the accuracy of our emissions 
data by building upon our calculation methodology and 
reporting our emissions according to the greenhouse 
gas protocol. this data will be used as a base for our 
carbon disclosure project (cdp) reporting. therefore for 
our analysis of the impact of our operations, we are using 
the scope definitions according to the greenhouse gas 
protocol with 2019 as the base year. 
in 2020 we have reduced scope 1 emission for our 
leased cars by reducing the amount of petrol-fueled 
cars and choosing diesel, hybrid and electric cars. our 
scope 2 emissions continue to be zero as we only source 
100% renewable energy for our fulfilment centre and 
headquarter. the digital footprint of our business is offset 
as all servers are hosted via the google cloud platform, 
which is run 100% on renewable energy. 
business travel reduction due to the covid pandemic has 
reduced our travel emissions from 170 ton co2 in 2019 to 
22 ton of co2 in 2020.

energy sourcing
a critical part of boozt’s goal has always been to scale 
up the use of renewable energy. we rely fully on clean 
energy sources to power all areas of our operations. 
the electricity we purchase to operate our local and 
automated fulfilment centre is hydropower produced 
in facilities certified according to the international edp 
(environmental product declaration), a system that offers 
objective and quality information based on iso 14025.

this energy increase can be explained by more output 
from our robots due to a higher number of orders. an 
increase of 14%, well below the net revenue growth of 27% 
compared to 2019, demonstrates the leverage on energy 
consumption from our business model and investments. 
facilities 
headquarter
in the spring of 2019, our head office moved to eminent, the 
first building in the nordics to be certified by well. the 
international well building institute (iwbi) is a globally 
recognised building standard focused on human health 
and wellness in workplaces. this new facility fosters a 
positive working environment including features such as a 
massage room and a play area for parents to bring their kids 
when needed. eminent is also environmentally certified 
with miljöbyggnad gold level, a swedish environmental 
certification for sustainable buildings by the sweden green 
building council. this certification guarantees a reduction 
of energy consumption by 25% compared to conventional 
buildings.
fulfilment centre
local and innovative, the boozt fulfilment centre 
(bfc) represents one of the most significant stops on a 
product’s journey to our customer’s door. since the bfc 
became operational, we have continued to optimise 
the quality, reliability, and sustainability of our fulfilment 
centre. in 2020, we further invested in advancing the 
bfc operations, expanding with a second warehouse 
building and new warehouse automation technologies in 
partnership with autostore, to optimise our product flows. 
as a green building certified facility, our fulfilment centre 
operations are driven by energy-efficient and modern 
technology. the solar panels contributed 13% of the total 
energy consumption at bfc in 2020, that is an increase 
from 8% in 2019. with the completion of the second 
warehouse more solar panels have been added to help 
power our services. the energy generated from these  
will be included in the 2021 energy consumption 
calculations.

distribution & returns
we aim to optimise the efficiency of our distribution 
in various ways, not only for customers to receive their 
orders in a timely and reliable manner, but also to reduce 
our environmental impact. many of the sustainability 
issues that we prioritise at boozt are enhanced through 
partnerships and collaborative initiatives that minimise 
co2 emissions in the supply chain and other local  
impacts.
we work with a variety of vendors to provide our customers 
with distribution alternatives that satisfy each delivery 
need. we strive to give customers the ability to select  
more environmentally-friendly alternatives, such as 
electric car delivery and climate compensated options. 
despite being dependent on the progress within our 
distribution partner’s operation, we endorse this agenda 
and share it with our partners. in 2020, we continued 
our work with our distribution partners to measure the 
emissions from shipping to our customers on a quarterly 
basis. regular reporting provides us with the opportunity 
to measure the impact of our operations as well as 
benchmark and set goals for continuous improvement. 
we received carbon data from our distribution partners 
representing 97% of our orders.
through our close collaboration, we are able to calculate 
the estimated carbon emissions per order delivered 
including returns, amounting to 0.3 kg co2 e. the low 
result is possible due to investments in the optimisation 
of our local distribution patterns. this involves a selection 
of climate compensated delivery options and efficient 
returns transportation in a closed-loop centred around our 
one local fulfilment centre. we are proud of this result and 
we have been able to maintain the industry low emissions 
also from 2020. thus, confirming the value of investing in 
local operations and resource-efficient solutions. 
returns 
one of the afflictions of running an e-commerce business 
is handling returns. a key focus for us has been to decrease 
the number of unnecessary returns to lower the co2 
emissions from transportation pick-ups and deliveries 
as well as the amount of materials used for repackaging 
items. lowering returns will also support the sustainability 
of the business model from an economic perspective.

we strive to keep our operations local and all our returns 
are handled in our fulfilment centre in Ängelholm, 
sweden. in 2019, we further optimised our processes in 
the return area at the fulfilment centre supported by best 
practice process optimisation from new management. 
this contributed to us being able to compete with 
outsourcing options for return handling by lowering the 
costs associated with returns. strategic partnerships have 
also continued to keep us competitive. many of the staff  
at the fulfilment centre, for example, are employed  
through our immigration integration project which helps 
refugees enter the swedish job market.
we also recently introduced a fair use policy that 
allows us to “pause” customers who show no intention 
of keeping the items they purchase. these customers 
have repeatedly placed unusually large orders, only to 
return all or almost all items or return several times on 
a large scale. with this effort, we aim to contribute and 
encourage more responsible shopping behaviour within 
e-commerce and encourage our industry peers to take 
real actions towards reducing returns. in 2020, we have 
seen the results of our various actions with the return  
rate declining approximately three percentage points. 
reducing returns through machine learning
decreasing the number of returns is tricky, however, we've established that a large percentage of returns 
is often due to the unpredictable sizing of a brand’s collection. we strive to eliminate the obvious mistakes 
when selecting a size by improving our size guide. an example of this is our machine learning-based size 
recommendation tool. through system developments and partnerships with our brands, we are working on 
creating size predictions for our customers. using machine learning technology, we have been able to collect 
information about customer size choices and returns to suggest the best size option available. this will help 
customers make the right sizing decision, independent of whether they have made previous purchases in 
this category. we aim to bring technology and fashion together to create the best customer experience and 
reduce size-related returns.

data privacy and security 
data security and integrity is a strategic priority for us and 
is at the forefront of our platform department’s agenda. 
with the introduction of the eu’s general data protection 
regulation (gdpr) in 2018, all our systems were examined 
to define data usage and procedures. as part of our 
compliance work, we have processes in place to meet  
eu laws and local law frameworks on data protection. 
in 2020, we began an external review of these processes 
to ensure they meet the latest regulatory requirements, 
such as stipulated in swedish, national, supplementary 
provisions and the eu eprivacy directive. boozt continues 
to strengthen its data security and privacy procedures. 
based on a risk-based approach, as advocated by gdpr, 
we will especially focus on high impact areas such as further 
improving our data breach management, internal training, 
and boozt's transparency towards our data subjects.
the boozt privacy policy gives our data subjects updated 
and relevant information on how, why and for how long 
personal data is processed, and how we sometimes share 
data with subcontractors and partners to better our services. 
it forms an important part of the transparency toolkit, 
together with direct control over many data subject rights 
through easily accessible settings in the boozt account. 
boozt is continually auditing and updating any processing 
taking place on boozt's behalf (through dpa:s) or shared with 
partners, to make sure that any processing of personal data 
entrusted to boozt from its customers and employees is both 
transparent, secure and necessary in relation to its purpose. 
boozt retains personal data only for such time as necessary 
for a specific processing and justified by its legal basis, or 
for as long as it has valid consent. both in compliance with 
gdpr, for the trust of our customers and employees, and for 
efficiency. we have put controls in place (and are continually 
improving) for data subjects to exercise their rights under 
gdpr, such as the right to erasure, the right to object and 
the right of access, in a way where this is done automatically 
where appropriate and by manual assistance where needed 
or of extra value to the data subject. 
established data infrastructure ensures that we stay 
informed about notifiable it vulnerabilities and can combat 
these at an early stage. our it systems are regularly 
tested, both internally and through third party penetration 
testing, to keep abreast with security threats. during 
2020, most of our employees worked remotely following 
local government restrictions and recommendations. we 
quickly adapted to this new operational environment by 
moving all of our it systems and services to a cloud based 
infrastructure, granting a higher level of flexibility. boozt 
has closely followed guidance and best practice after 
the cjeu "schrems ii" case in july 2020 and is making 
an ongoing effort to ensure transfer mechanisms needed 
for subcontractors outside of eu/eea are meeting gdpr 
requirements even after the privacy shield certification 
system was annulled, both for new and old suppliers of 
infrastructure and data processing services.

material management
packaging
our customers want to receive the right-sized, recyclable 
packaging materials that minimise waste and ensure 
damage-free and intact delivery. as we look for more 
circular options for packaging solutions, the impact 
of packaging is a core area of focus for boozt. the 
conversation about what constitutes an environmentally 
better option remains complex. however, the role of 
packaging remains relevant to online businesses. despite 
it constituting a small part of the overall impact of a 
garment’s lifecycle, packaging provides opportunities to 
discover more sustainable alternatives. 
the first boozt.com bag in 2012 was made from 50% 
recyclable plastic. over the years we continued to 
improve the composition of the bag. first, by increasing 
the percentage of recycled plastic and then in 2018 we 
set an ambitious target to introduce bags composed of 
fossil-free material. in collaboration with a packaging 
supplier, we developed boozt.com bags made of 100% 
biodegradable food waste. unfortunately, there were 
challenges with recycling, as the adoption of recycling 
opportunities for bio-degradable bags progressed slower 
than anticipated. currently, the industrially compostable 
facilities in the region which boozt operates lack the 
proper infrastructure, including the necessary structures 
for proper post-consumer collecting, sorting and 
composting. therefore, compostable material may end up 
in the recycling stream of plastic, decreasing the quality 
and recyclability of the end product. due to this, we have 
decided to suspend the use of biodegradable bags and 
hope to reintroduce them once the proper handling 
facilities become available.
in 2019, we addressed the issues with the biodegradable 
bag and during 2020, we shifted to 100% recycled, blue 
angel certified, plastic material for our shipping bags. 
we have also maintained the dialogue with our partners 
searching for possible ways to reduce the use of polybags 
and the need to utilise new raw materials. our shipping 
boxes are also made of a single material from 100% 
certified paper to ensure full traceability and recyclability. 
we will continue our long-term research for more circular 
and sustainable material for our packaging alternatives. 
we aim to provide proof of concept for our industry 
partners when testing new packaging solutions, sharing 
what knowledge we have learned across our industry, 
which we believe can amplify the impact. 
waste management & recycling
for both our business and customers, we are persistent 
in our effort to eliminate waste across our operations. the 
recycling process of all packaging material from inbound 
deliveries is handled through efficient sorting systems at 
the boozt fulfilment centre. recycled materials consist 
mainly of paper, wood, and plastic. thanks to a close 
partnership with a local waste management facility, we 
recycle 80% of our waste. however, not everything can 
be recycled. any remaining non-recyclable materials are 
burned for energy recovery in one of two certified centres 
in sweden. looking ahead, we know this is not our final 
stop. we will continue to explore ways to reduce and 
reuse our material resources before recycling to extend a 
material’s life cycle and close the loop on the waste within 
our operations.

history of the boozt bag 
from the start we have made responsible choices about how 
we choose to package our products. the first boozt.com bag 
was made from 50% recyclable plastic - a decisions taken back 
when recycling options for packaging were still not part  
of the conversation.
we introduced our 100% biodegradable bags.  
in collaboration with a packaging supplier, boozt.com bags 
were made completely from biodegradable food waste.  
the material used was mater-bi from the international  
leader in bioplastic novamont and biodegradable and 
compostable according to european standard en13432.
during 2020, we shifted to 100% recycled, blue angel certified, 
plastic material for our shipping bags. we are also in dialogue 
with our packaging partners to explore possible ways  
to reduce the use of polybags and the need to utilise  
new raw material.
we improved the composition of the material used in  
the boozt.com bags. the recyclable material increased  
from 50% to 80% recyclable plastic and resulted in less  
waste and lighter weight during transportation.

trust
freedom
responsibility
trust at boozt is based on 
mutual respect and confidence, 
having the same goals, sharing 
the same motivations and 
ultimately, sharing common 
interests. therefore, a core 
belief at boozt is that by relying 
on each other, we make 
everyone stronger. trust  
means that everyone feels 
secure and when we feel 
secure, we can unfold our 
creativity and competencies. 
individuals can reach their 
fullest potential when they  
have the freedom to act and 
solve daily tasks in their own, 
unique way. our people don’t 
really like being told what to do, 
and they want the freedom to 
make their own decisions, to 
learn, to be themselves and to 
suggest new ways of thinking 
and doing. we believe in having 
full freedom as long as we act in 
boozt’s best interest.
freedom comes with 
responsibility. we want our 
people to take responsibility 
for customers’, boozts’, 
and colleagues' interests. 
in our experience, by 
acting responsibly and with 
accountability, we can achieve 
the kind of freedom to which  
we aspire in our daily lives.
employee empowerment
our success at boozt is a product of our talented, hard- 
working people and the array of skills and knowledge 
they bring to the table. knowing this, we strive to create 
a work environment that provides opportunities for their 
continuous development and satisfaction to amplify our 
business and sustainability goals. to continue growing as 
a company, we must invest in the growth of our employees.
health & wellbeing
the outbreak of covid-19 at the beginning of 2020  
affected all aspects of daily life, including our ways of work-
ing. the health and safety of our employees is our main  
priority and we quickly acted to ensure that our people 
had the tools and resources to work from home. the 
added distance requires new solutions to enable every-
one to stay connected with the business and each other. 
we increased the internal communication with frequent  
updates from our ceo and monthly live-streamed ‘all 
staff’ meetings with updates from around the business. 
work equipment was delivered home to the teams that 
required specific/stationary equipment, such as customer 
service and platform, and all physical events were moved 
online. thanks to the commitment of our people we have 
stayed fully operational under these trying circumstances. 
our values; freedom, trust and responsibility will contin-
ue to be the drivers for our approach for a healthy work/
life balance, even after the pandemic and restrictions. 
our employees have access to medical evaluation and 
advice, including occupational health, on a weekly basis 
from an inhouse primary care doctor. during 2020, the 
doctor also offered voluntary tests for covid-19. this, along 
with stricter hygiene measures and physical-distancing 
procedures, has enabled us to have a small number of 
our people working safely from the office. we believe 
that having access to a medical professional, especially 
during this year, helps us tend to the wellbeing of our 
people and reduce sick-leave. in 2020, 30 employees 
(6.8%) were on sick leave for more than 14 days.
professional growth and job satisfaction 
we believe in giving freedom and responsibility for 
personal career development by offering our people 
opportunities to develop themselves professionally within 
the company. we promote internal hires and encourage 
individuals to apply for internal positions when they feel 
ready to take the next step in their career or to explore

other areas of the business. in this way, we can retain 
critical talent and skills in the business while allowing our 
people to evolve and challenge themselves. 
in 2019 we introduced our employee engagement survey 
platform, with the goal to make it easier for our people to 
instantly and anonymously share their thoughts regarding 
the company culture, how teams are managed and the 
overall direction of the company. questions are sent out 
to all employees on a monthly basis, providing the oppor-
tunity for our people to frequently offer their feedback and 
opinions. this allows them to have more of an immediate 
influence over their work environment. the answers serve 
as a basis for management to make informed decisions 
about our people's work satisfaction and take the nec-
essary actions to ensure that we are providing a healthy 
company culture that stimulates the effectiveness and  
motivation of each team and individual. 
in 2020 the aggregated participation rate for the survey 
was 74% (80%). the platform also uses an employee net 
promoter score (enps) to benchmark employee engage-
ment with others in the same sector. this year the enps 
score was 40, which puts us just below the top 25% for the 
consumer sector. by 2021 our goal is to continuously im-
prove employee feedback and dialogue to reach top tier 
employee engagement benchmarked against our sector. 
we can see that the teams who have worked actively with 
employee feedback in 2020 have also seen a significant 
improvement throughout the year on the enps. we will 
continue working with the survey tool, investing more time 
and resources to improve engagement in the coming year. 
fostering diversity & equality
we believe that the core strength of our company is 
the diversity of our backgrounds. at 33 nationalities, we 
acknowledge our differences but still share the same goals. 
additionally, we strongly believe in and actively support 
women’s and men’s equal rights in terms of employment, 
working conditions and professional development. 
there are no differences in terms of professional roles, 
recruitment, training and remuneration levels which can 
be explained by gender or ethnicity. 
parental leave for both men and women is an intrinsic 
part of our company and our people have the ability to 
combine part-time parental leave with part-time work. in 
2020, 48 of our employees (11%) were on parental leave.
business ethics 
anti-corruption & bribery policy 
our anti-corruption, insider and procurement policies 
are there to ensure that the business is conducted 
ethically. these policies outline our various positions 
on preventing and prohibiting corruption and bribery 
in accordance with local legislation where we operate 
as well as significant international regulatory regimes 
and laws with extraterritorial reach such as the uk 
bribery act and the us foreign corruption practices 
act. these policies include never-acceptable practices 
and monitoring activities to support the prevention of  
corruption, bribery, and conflicts of interest.
we are aware of the inherent risk that individuals in our 
operations or through interaction with us may breach 
legal requirements and our ethical principles related 
to anti-corruption and business ethics. anti-corruption 
policies are communicated to all brands and business 
partners through our buying and merchandising depart-
ment. amongst the never accepted practices is the strict 
prohibition to accepting or offering purchase discounts, 
commissions, bonuses or kickbacks from our brands for 
personal gain. the policies also detailed specific restric-
tions regarding private purchases by employees from 
our suppliers/ brands for private use or consumption, at 
below-market prices. likewise, our anti-corruption policy 
establishes that our employees must not accept gifts or 
any other compensation as there is a possibility that these 
may be perceived to improperly influence business de-
cisions. the anti-corruption policy also expresses typical 
situations in which gifts from suppliers can be considered 
to be a means to influence business decisions.
our position on corruption is conveyed through our 
learning management system. to ensure communication 
of the internal code of conduct to all levels of the company, 
all employees sign a document acknowledging its receipt.

to further emphasise the code of conduct, staff are given 
a learning module within the lms accompanied by a 
quiz. no substantiated complaints of corruption or anti-
competitive behaviour were reported in 2020.
whistleblower policy
our whistleblower policy was adopted with the aim of 
encouraging a transparent business environment where 
we operate profitably while maintaining good ethics. 
we are committed to the handling and reporting of any 
wrongdoing. the whistleblower channel is available to 
all employees to report any illegal activity or violations to 
the code of conduct or other policies we have. beyond 
communicating our policies to our staff through learning 
modules via the lms, all documents are readily available 
via an online employee folder. extra training material 
on how and when to use the whistleblower channel has 
been included in our new employee training programs. 
the whistleblower channel supported by an external 
supplier is used to support such reporting, and all cases 
are reported to the chairman of the board of directors.  
no cases were reported in the whistleblower channel  
in 2020
incident management
boozt is committed to contributing to the creation of healthier 
and happier employees. we feel investing in the wellbeing 
of our people will lead to more positive and sustained work 
output and retention. our hr-policy covers occupational 
health and safety, as well as employee wellbeing. to cultivate 
and maintain a nourishing working environment, we perform 
continuous risk assessments and use experts in the field to 
help evaluate risks and set plans. we support the right to 
freedom of association for all our employees as stated in our 
code of conduct. we have collective bargaining agreements 
for employees at our offices and the boozt fulfilment centre.
occupational safety at our headquarters
healthy and safe workplaces are a top priority. any 
assessed risks related to the working environment are 
managed through a systematic approach to occupational 
health and safety (ohs). risks at our head office include 
health risks due to poor ergonomics, lighting or ventilation, 
and also psychosocial risks, such as from stress. all 
employees who manage personnel are required to go 
through ohs training by external facilitators. the training 
includes work environment regulations, systematic 
occupational health and safety, organisational and social 
work environment and rehabilitation.
the purpose of our occupational health and safety (ohs) 
management system is to identify, assess, follow-up and 
develop working environmental goals to mitigate risks 
for all workers. risk assessments are documented and 
assessed by management. a review of the boozt ohs 
system is also conducted on an annual basis by the 
management and board. these results form the basis for 
the yearly ohs plan. we register the occurrence of any 
and all accidents. for severe accidents, which need to be 
reported to authorities in accordance with regulations, no 
incidents or accidents were reported in 2020.
occupational safety at the fulfilment centre
the safety of the working staff at the fulfilment centre is 
essential to our operations, and we aim for zero occupational 
injuries. all working conditions and environmental 
hazards are carefully considered. the fulfilment centre 
encompasses the most modern standards for excellent 
air quality, lighting, safety and cleanliness. the greatest 
threat posed at the fulfilment centre is the risk of fire. fire 
prevention is managed systematically, with documented 
continuous safety rounds being performed and worker 
training. other risks related to the work environment 
include physical risks, mainly in the handling of products 
and product returns, and also psychosocial risks, such as 
stress-related to repetitive tasks and prolonged standing. 
the most common work-related injury is shoulder pain 
from recurring work. to prevent the high potential for work-
related incidences, we conduct frequent risk analyses 
and have been focusing on rotating the type of work the  
staff operates daily. this includes the addition of new 
routines and processes, integrating new equipment and 
making adjustments to static tasks. for severe accidents, 
which need to be reported to authorities in accordance 
with regulations, no incidents or accidents were reported 
in 2020.

our partners
we want to inspire our partners to make a positive impact on the value chain.  
by partnering with key stakeholders, sharing our knowledge and best practice,  
we aim to encourage a more sustainable industry.
the industry faces many challenges on the road to 
implementing 
more 
sustainable 
practices 
across 
the supply chain. collaborative action is needed in 
accelerating change and finding scalable solutions that 
drive lasting improvements. using our position and size, 
we aim to investigate and share best practices with 
our partners and peers to be the catalyst for defining 
the new norm for a sustainable e-commerce business 
operating in the fashion industry. our teams work to 
develop partnerships with our brands and distributors to 
communicate our standards and help our partners build 
their sustainability capacity. it is through our partnerships 
that we can have an indirect impact on environmental and 
social performance in the supply chain. 
as consumer behaviour changes and the demand for 
better-made products in terms of environmental and 
social impact increases, so does the need for relevant and 
transparent data. as part of our responsibility vision, we 
want to support our brand partners on their sustainability 
journey, helping them set milestones and track progress 
using measurable and comparable data. with improved 
transparency we can ensure that our partners share our 
sustainability values and that our customers can make 
informed purchasing decisions. 
supply chain transparency
we believe the greatest challenge and opportunity for 
change in the fashion supply chain is within data. the 
information we are able to share with our customers is 
only as good as the data we can gather from our brand 
partners. for us, this means taking proactive approaches 
to improve product data, developing sustainability guides 
for customers and increasing targeted communication. 
to achieve full transparency of the whole supply chain 
requires close collaboration with our brand partners.
human rights risks in the apparel and fashion industry 
have been well documented over the years. there has 
been growing pressure on brands and manufacturers to 
improve control of their supply chain. as a retailer, we 
strive to ensure that any products and goods sold have 
sustainability report
67
boozt ab / annual report 2020
been produced under safe and fair working conditions. 
our boozt group code of conduct for suppliers aims to 
outline minimum requirements for suppliers, including 
respect for human rights and decent working conditions. 
the standards set out in the document are based on 
the un universal declaration of human rights and the 
conventions of the international labour organization 
(ilo). suppliers must meet all legal requirements and 
regulations in operating countries.
supply chains are complex and difficult to trace. we will 
continue the dialogue to locate the easiest and best 
way to use our technology expertise to systematically 
collect, review and share information. transparency in 
the supply chain is a long-term commitment. recognising 
this commitment, we will continue pushing for more 
transparency in the supply chain in 2021, including 
facilitating data. we remain dedicated to working with our 
brand partners to create the most efficient way to gather 
information and work across the fashion supply chain.
sac and higg membership. 
in 2020 we took an important step towards transparency 
in the apparel, footwear and textile industry by joining 
the sustainable apparel coalition (sac). the sac is the 
fashion industry’s leading sustainability alliance committed 
to full environmental and social transparency. boozt 
has joined the more than 250 global brands, retailers, 
and manufacturers, as well as government, non-profit 
environmental organisations, and academic institutions, 
which are collectively committed to improving supply chain  
sustainability in the apparel, footwear, and textile industry. 
as members, we will have access to standardized tools to 
measure environmental and social impact to continuously set 
high standards for our business and the industry. with our 
position as the leading multi-brand retailer in the nordics, 
boozt can positively impact the fashion industry by driving 
transparency through the value chain and product lifecycle at 
scale. that is why, by 2023, we have set a goal to only work 
with brands that are committed to providing comparable 
supply chain data through our sustainability assessments. 
we will use the higg brand & retail module (higg brm), 
a tool developed by the sac together with higg co, to 
better identify improvement areas and help our brands 
move forward in their sustainability journey while also 
providing our customers with detailed and data-based 
information about a product’s sustainability performance. 
industry collaboration 
we achieve many of the sustainability efforts we prioritise 
at boozt through collaborations where we seek mutually 
beneficial partnerships. in 2019, we focused on taking 
strategic steps to support our data collection from brands 
with the aim of motivating brands to become more engaged 
with sustainability. this was a continued focus for 2020 as 
well as partnering with researchers and experts within 
the field of e-commerce and sustainability to gain better 
insights as to the real impact of the business model. that 
way we can find effective solutions that the industry can 
collectively take to lower the impact on the environment.

the danish and swedish fashion ethical charter
as a supplier of fashion, we acknowledge our role in the 
fashion industry as it relates to the treatment of models 
used in our campaigns. in 2018, we became a member 
of the danish fashion ethical charter and the swedish 
fashion ethical charter. the purpose of these charters 
and our commitment is to ensure the well-being of the 
models within the danish and swedish fashion industry. 
the charters require the adherence of rules in the form of 
health checks, age limits, healthy diets and wages for the 
models and are signed by a broad coalition of stakeholders 
within the industry. as a signatory, we are committed to 
abiding by these rules to ensure the wellbeing of models. 
as we work with many models, boozt seeks to contribute 
to raising awareness of mental illnesses and influencing 
positive attitudes in fashion, media and society.
hållbar e-handel (sustainable e-commerce) 
we believe that sharing best-practices, data and insights 
around how to build a more sustainable future for 
e-commerce is the way to develop lasting solutions to the 
industry’s most pressing issues. we want to lead by example 
in the areas we are strong and learn from experts and 
peers when we can. in 2020 we became members of the 
hållbar e-handel, an initiative that brings together industry 
stakeholders in sweden to set measurable standards 
for sustainable e-commerce. we also have a seat in the 
board. as members of the hållbar e-handel initiative, we 
collaborate with peers and academics to better understand 
the impact of the e-commerce model on the environment. 
during 2020 we have been leading a research project, 
together with the university of gothenburg, on the topic of 
responsible return handling within e-commerce. we hope 
the results of the research will present tangible examples of 
sustainable solutions for returns.
community engagement
we use our size and reach as one of the leading online 
retailers in the nordics to support a number of charities 
and causes within society that have a positive social 
impact. the contributions we made in 2020 have gone 
into helping important causes on their mission to make a 
difference. as our business grows we aim to invest more 
in giving back to our local community the coming year. 
5-skoler 
this year we have worked in close partnership with the 
charity 5-skoler to support their efforts to help children 
in areas of war, conflict and disaster. the danish led 
program builds life-education-centres for children in 
syria, giving them the opportunity for an education and 
a more secure future. our donations have gone towards 
the girls’ empowerment project that focuses on creating 
a safe and equal environment for the young girls in 
syrian refugee camps, as well as helping provide school 
uniforms for the children in the life-education-centres. 
knæk cancer
for the seventh year in a 
row, boozt has brought 
together a strong team 
to raise awareness about 
cancer prevention and 
research. since 2015, we 
have through our brand 
collaborations raised sek 
5.5 million which have 
been donated to knæk 
cancer. in 2020 alone, 
we have raised more than sek 1 million for this important 
cause. the full amount raised goes toward the prevention, 
research, and support for patients and relatives. we are 
grateful to everyone that has been involved in the project 
and appreciate the sustained support. we will continue 
to partner with well known nordic fashion brands to 
bring greater awareness and support the knæk cancer 
campaign.

taking an active role in  
the nordic fashion eco-system
we take our leading role in nordic fashion 
seriously. our ambition is to make the fashion 
world accessible for all, which is why we in 
2020 partnered with the first-ever digital 
edition of stockholm fashion week. sharing 
our values of sustainability and innovation, 
the new format means more of the community 
can tap into an inspirational experience 
that highlights nordic fashion and design. 
on the same note, we also want to provide 
upcoming local brands with a platform to 
reach the nordic customers. an example is 
the new talent award that boozt hosted in 
partnership with stockholm fashion week. 
the award highlights and rewards emerging 
designers and brands that display a unique 
design aesthetic as well as a sustainability 
commitment and a clear business strategy.

information about products. thanks to our local position 
in the nordics and the market where we operate, we 
partner with local brands that are driving the movement 
within the fashion sector. through brand and industry 
knowledge partners, we can build a framework to better 
navigate our changing industry.
doing good and making responsible choices lies at the 
heart of our organisation. we want our customers to 
feel confident that when they buy from us, knowing that 
they are shopping with a responsible business. from the 
investments taken to run on 100% renewable energy in 
our environmentally-friendly fulfilment centre to working 
with our brands to ensure transparency, fair treatment and 
responsible production in the supply chain, we want our 
customers to rest assured.
more and more of our customers are becoming curious 
about sustainable fashion and how they can contribute to 
making a positive impact on the environment. as a part of 
the fashion industry, together with our brands, we strive to 
take our consumers on a journey towards more sustainable 
fashion consumption. we have curated one of the largest 
sustainability selections in the nordics, with products that 
meet our industry-leading standards of sustainability. it is 
important to us that shopping sustainably is made easy for 
our customers and that they can trust that the products we 
have curated have a positive impact on the environment 
and community.

with our sustainable category, we highlight brands 
that emphasise sustainability and support those at the 
beginning of their journey. thanks to our local position in 
the nordics and the market where we operate, we partner 
with brands that are driving the movement to produce 
more responsibly within the fashion sector. through the 
selection and content available, we can offer customers 
high-quality, timeless designs and reliable information to 
shop with confidence according to the values that matter 
the most to them. in 2020, we have updated the category 
in terms of filtering options and information on a product 
level. this has made it easier for customers to identify and 
discover sustainable alternatives. our focus is to improve 
the user experience for our consumers when shopping for 
our sustainable selection.

a strong focus on quality exists in all that we offer to our 
customers and is no less true for our sustainable selection. 
more than 350 brands are part of the sustainability 
category and in 2020 we increased the composition of the 
sustainability selection across our overall assortment to 
17%. as we are further committed to promoting sustainable 
fashion across our platform our goal is to reach 25% of 
our stock apparel composition to be a more sustainable 
alternative by the end of 2022.
we have set industry-leading standards as the found-
ation for our sustainable category in terms of material 
composition 
and 
better 
manufacturing 
processes. 
all selected products must fulfil our criteria* for what 
constitutes a sustainable product. each product must be 
made of either sustainable materials or have sustainable 
certifications. this means all styles are made from 
more than 50% organic, recycled or low environmental 
impact materials, and/or accredited by internationally 
recognised certifications. having a minimum requirement

example of where we are leading in our criteria. 
requirements for the sustainable category and guidelines 
for data sharing are available in our b2b platform to 
ensure transparency with all of our brand partners. 
knowledge sources that have been used in setting our 
requirements are according to industry benchmarking 
and standards provided by already existing guidelines, 
industry standards, and research*. 
our sustainability requirements are being constantly 
reviewed to inspire change and to keep updated with 
the latest research. we want to increase traceability 
and promote consciously made products. with our part-
nership with the sustainable apparel coalition, we will 
work towards building a new product transparency and 
performance standard leveraging the industry-leading 
higg index tool and data. through our collaboration and

setting industry standards 
fair use policy 
as part of our efforts to lead the change towards a more 
responsible industry, we have taken a stand against 
unnecessary returns. in 2019, boozt introduced the 
fair use policy to our terms & conditions as a way to 
eliminate unnecessary returns and establish more 
sustainable business practices. returns are an integral 
part of shopping online and we want to make it as easy as 
possible for our customers to return. however, fair use 
helps us have a transparent and honest dialogue with, 
and possibly pause, customers that repeatedly exploit 
our high service levels of free shipping and returns at 
the expense of our business, other customers and the 
environment. 
around 13,000 customers, or 0.25% of the total customer 
base, have been paused through the fair use policy. this 
is a small part of the more than 2 million active customers 
on boozt and booztlet, yet these customers represent 
around 15% of our total return volume. this includes orders 
not shipped and returned due to fair use customers. 
by pausing these accounts and reducing unnecessary 
returns boozt has eliminated the need for approximately 
130 delivery trucks during one year and lowered the total 
carbon emissions by an amount equivalent to 25% of the 
returns co2 footprint.
the vast majority of our customers, 99.8%, shop thought-
fully and only ship goods when needed. however, we  
have seen a significant increase in extreme return 
behaviour within the last few years. this behaviour is not 
sustainable for the environment or the business and is 
not fair to other customers as their shopping experience 
is compromised - either through a lesser service, smaller 
selection or higher prices. we hope to influence our 
industry peers to similar solutions to this increasing issue 
for the e-commerce business model.

animal welfare policy
as sellers of animal-derived products, we have a respons-
ibility to uphold animal welfare within our supply chain. 
since 2016, boozt is a fur-free company and a signatory 
of the retailer commitment against fur agreement in 
cooperation with swedish animal rights organization 
djurens rätt. the fur free retailer program is recognized 
by the iso 26000:2010 guidelines to corporate social 
responsibility as an example of sectoral initiatives. 
in 2020 we have further developed our animal welfare 
policy by updating our principles with specific banned 
materials and the responsible treatment certification we 
prefer. boozt does not permit the use of any fur, feathers 
or any skins of snake, crocodile, alligator or any species 
specified in the iucn red list of threatened species in 
any of our products. 
we are aware of the challenges the fashion industry faces 
with regard to animal welfare and the ethical issues sur-
rounding the well- being and treatment of animals. our 
product management team methodically inspects all  
materials when product data is received from the brands. 
we have not sold any goods which violate our fur policy on 
our sites, nor have we sold any items with prohibited mate-
rials. the inspection controls are therefore considered to 
be effective. we are working on strengthening systematic 
preventive controls to further strengthen internal control. 
environmental policy
we conduct a yearly follow-up of our direct environmental 
impact and have initiated mapping and measuring of 
indirect impacts. through our environmental policy, we 
aim to reduce our direct environmental impact and raise 
awareness among vendors and partners of our existing 
policies concerning any environmental impacts and to 
encourage them to adhere to these principles. in 2020 we 
have updated our environmental policy by committing to 
work proactively and continuously to identify challenges, 
set priorities and report on our progress through well- 
established standards such as the greenhouse gas  
protocol and gri (global reporting index).
shopping with confidence
part of our responsibility vision is to use our position 
and competences to make sustainable choices easy 
for our customers. our customers should feel confident 
that through their boozt purchase, they are supporting 
a business that makes responsible choices in all parts of 
the value chain. providing information about the impact of 
materials and production processes, empowers customers 
to make more educated decisions about the products 
they buy. this means actively informing our customers 
of the latest initiatives that promote a sustainable fashion 
industry and sharing any knowledge that we acquire 
through research, materiality analysis, and best practices.
in 2020, we created greater awareness of our sustainable 
products and the new sustainable edit. dedicated 
marketing email campaigns and onsite placements were 
aimed to inspire customers toward more sustainable 
choices. these emails also included information about the 
different sustainable materials, internationally recognised 
certifications and better manufacturing process that serve 
as the criteria for our sustainable edit.
going forward we will work on crossover communication 
to all of our platforms to increase customer awareness and 
inspire interest in sustainable fashion. in 2020, we have 
extended our communication reach to social media via 
weekly sustainability posts. this has been an opportunity 
to engage with our customers on a valuable topic as 
well as to facilitate engagement. we also launched our 
sustainability focused content page online focused 
on educating customers on how to best care for their 
products to both lengthen the lifespan of a garment while 
also having a positive impact on the environment. as part 
of our efforts to educate consumers, we have elevated 
our boozt care concept by including information about 
more sustainable alternatives as well as insights into 
the sustainability journeys of our leading nordic brand 
partners. we will further develop our efforts using our 
newly launched online magazine ‘the edit’ ensuring that 
we reach our large customer base across all platforms.

boozt ab / annual report 2020
boozt ab (publ) is a swedish public limited liability 
company listed on nasdaq omx stockholm (mid cap) 
and nasdaq omx copenhagen (mid cap). corporate 
governance refers to the system through which 
shareholders directly or indirectly govern the company. 
the company´s governance is based on swedish law,  
the company’s articles of associations, nasdaq 
stockholm´s rule book for issuers and internal rules 
and instructions. the company also applies the swedish 
corporate governance code (the “code”). the code 
applies to all swedish companies with shares listed  
on a regulated market in sweden. 
the company is not obliged to comply with all rules in 
the code since the code provides for the possibility to 
deviate from the rules, provided that any such deviations 
and the chosen alternative solutions are described and 
that the reasons for the deviation are explained in the 
corporate governance report (according to the “comply or 
explain principle”).
during 2020 boozt did not deviate from the code. 
cross listing and danish corporate governance 
boozt is a swedish public limited liability company and 
accordingly, boozt follows swedish rules, regulations and 
guidelines as described above. however, as a company 
with shares admitted to trading on both nasdaq omx 
stockholm and nasdaq omx copenhagen, boozt is 
required to each year provide a general description 
of the main differences between the code and the 
danish recommendations on corporate governance (the 
“recommendations”) issued by the danish committee on 
corporate governance. the company has no obligation to 
follow or report separately on the recommendations. 
the overall aims and principles of the code and the 
recommendations are similar and include recommen-
dations in relation to shareholder engagement, tasks and 
procedures of the board of directors, board composition 
and board committees as well as management 
remuneration. 
the overall differences are described below. 
shareholder engagement
election of chair of the annual general meeting
the code stipulates that the chair of the annual general 
meeting shall be appointed by the nomination committee. 
in a danish context, the board of directors will usually 
appoint a chair of the general meeting and this is not 
regulated in the recommendations. 
minutes of the annual general meeting
the code recommends that a shareholder who is 
independent from the company and its board of directors 
is appointed to verify and sign the minutes of general 
meetings. such practice does not exist in denmark and 
the minutes are approved and signed by the chair of the 
general meeting in accordance with danish company law. 
policies 
the recommendations include recommendations for a 
listed company to adopt policies regarding communication 
and investor relations as well as adopt contingency proce-
dures in case of a public takeover of the company. such 
recommendations are not included in the code, however 
boozt has adopted a communications policy which gov-
erns both internal and external communications, including 
in relation to investors. boozt has not currently adopted 
formal written procedures in case of a public takeover.
procedures and tasks of the board of directors 
participation in daily management
pursuant to the recommendations, any participation by a 
board member in the daily management of the company 
shall be approved by the board and publicly disclosed. 
none of the members of the board of directors of boozt 
participates in the daily management of the company. 
board composition and board committees
independence of board members
the code distinguishes between board members’ 
independence from the company and its executive 
management and independence from the company’s 
major shareholders in two separate recommendations. 
independence in relation to major shareholders is not 
a part of the recommendations, however in order to be 
considered independent a board member should not be 
a representative of or be associated with a controlling 
shareholder. 
corporate governance report
79
boozt ab / annual report 2020
chair of the board
the code stipulates that the chair of the board shall be 
elected by the general meeting. this is not the case in a 
danish context. further, the specific tasks of the chair are 
more detailed in the code, however danish practice is in 
line with the tasks and responsibilities of the code. the 
recommendations stipulate that a deputy chair shall be 
elected, which is not included in the code.
board committees 
both the code and the recommendations stipulate that a 
company should have an audit committee, a remuneration 
committee and a nomination committee. 
a main difference between the code and the recom-
mendation is that a nomination committee pursuant to 
the code consists of members elected directly by the 
shareholders whereas members of a nomination commit-
tee pursuant to the recommendations are elected by and 
among members of the board of directors. the tasks of 
the nomination committee in a swedish context are also 
more comprehensive than the tasks of the nomination 
committee in a danish context.
the company follows the swedish practice pursuant to 
the code, and accordingly the nomination committee 
consists of shareholder elected committee members and 
the tasks carried out are in line with the recommendations 
of the code. 
management remuneration 
performance criteria
pursuant to the code any variable remuneration is to be 
linked to predetermined and measurable performance 
criteria. in a danish context variable remuneration is 
more broadly defined, and there is no recommendation 
that predetermined and measurable performance criteria 
should be applied, however any performance criteria, if 
applied, should be described in the remuneration policy. 
approval of incentive programmes 
according to the code, all share based incentive 
programmes are to be approved by the general meeting, 
including the principle conditions for the programme. 
in a danish context share based programmes may be 
established and approved by the board as long as such 
programme is within the limits of the remuneration policy 
as adopted by the general meeting. 
board compensation
the recommendations stipulate that board members 
should not be provided with variable remuneration. the 
code stipulates that programmes designed for board 
members are to be devised by the company’s owners and 
to promote long-term ownership.

on internal controls
to ensure that boozt complies with applicable laws and regulations and to ensure 
that the group’s values are incorporated throughout the organisation the group 
has adopted a code of conduct with mandatory principles regarding behaviour 
for management and employees. additionally, several group-wide policies have 
been adopted and a process for managing governing documents such as policies 
and procedures has been implemented.
in addition to the overall risk management system, a level of expected 
governance and key controls has been stipulated for identified key processes of 
the operations and supporting financial processes. the expected governance 
and key controls should be in place at all times with the purpose to enhance 
and ensure a sufficient level of internal controls. at least once a year the board 
evaluates the identified top 20 risks of the company and discuss with group 
management the prioritisation of risks and which activities should be in place to 
mitigate any impact of risks.
processes relating to financial closing and reporting are specifically considered 
in the internal control system. it appoints ownership of sub-processes and 
accountability to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations and internal 
policies and procedures. processes managing the business and delivering value 
shall be defined within the business management system. further descriptions 
(procedures, instructions) within the group shall be aligned with these processes. 
group ceo is responsible for the process structure within the group.
the board’s focus is to strengthen the self-assessments of internal processes 
systematically in order to secure as little impact as possible in the event of errors 
or inadequacies.

information and communication
the group’s policies and procedures are updated on 
an ongoing basis by the appointed policy owner. the 
board of directors assesses the need to add/update or 
delete policies continuously. policies are shared with all 
employees via a shared online portal. the policy owner 
is responsible to ensure that all employees to whom the 
policy is of importance are informed and aware of policies 
that should be applied.
a self-assessment of minimum requirements of defined 
controls mitigating identified risks for each business 
process shall annually be performed and reported to the 
audit committee and the board of directors. group cfo 
is responsible for the self-assessment process, which is 
facilitated by the internal controls function. in addition, 
the internal controls function performs reviews of the risk 
and internal controls system according to the plan agreed 
with the board of directors and group management.
the self-assessment has been carried out during 2020 
without any significant findings and has been reported 
to the audit committee and the board of directors 
accordingly.
monitoring
boozt group shall comply with applicable laws and the 
governing documents are a support for this. management

with respect to the company´s current size and operations, 
the board of directors has decided not to have a separate 
internal audit function, but it annually assesses the need 
of such a function. the board has again assessed in 2020 
that the most effective method for the monitoring and 
follow-up of internal control in the group still is through an 
internal control function, which is integrated in the group's 
finance function. this internal control function monitors 
all subsidiaries of the group. the function regularly 
reports to the group cfo, who in turn reports back to

director's report
operations in the parent company are exercised by 
owning and managing its wholly-owned subsidiary 
boozt fashion ab and its subsidiaries. during 2020, 
main activities of the group were conducted in boozt 
fashion ab who runs boozt.com which is one of the 
leading players in the nordic e-commerce market for 
fashion, beauty, kids, sport and home. 
the board of directors and the group ceo of boozt 
ab (publ), corporate id no. 556793-5183, registered in 
sweden and with its head office in malmö, hereby present 
their annual report for the financial year of 2020. 
further information on the business
boozt is a nordic technology company selling fashion on-
line. this includes fashion for women, men, kids, sports/
athleisure, beauty and home interior. the group offers 
its customers a curated and contemporary selection of 
fashion brands, relevant to a variety of lifestyles through 
the multi-brand webstores boozt.com and booztlet.com. 
boozt.com had 2,043,000 active customers as per dec 
31, 2020 (1,606,000) because of a convenient shopping 
experience with high service levels across both mobile 
devices and desktop, quick deliveries, and easy returns. 
this has yielded a high customer satisfaction indicated 
by a net promoter score (nps) of 70 (69) and a trustpilot 
score of 4.6 (4.6). this results in very attractive unit 
economics where customers show a strong degree of 
loyalty giving a payback of less than 18 months on the 
investment in new customers.
boozt targets nordic fashion followers, primarily consum-
ers aged 25-54, that value convenience and a relevant 
offer in their customer experience and which tend to  
generate a high average order value. 
boozt operates a tailor-made, integrated technology plat-
form that enables the group to manage the customer 
experience and to accommodate further growth. fulfilment 
is executed through the automated fulfilment centre 
which is strategically located in Ängelholm. the fulfilment 
centre consist of two independent cubes with 43,500 m2 
(77,000 m2 at maximum build- out), 490 picking robots and 
capacity exceeding 1,500,000 stock keeping unit (“sku”), 
that enables next-day delivery to 90% of the nordic region. 
boozt also have capacity of same-day delivery to 3.5 
million inhabitants in the south of sweden and denmark. 
boozt has a strong track-record of growth, mainly driven 
by the fast evolution of boozt.com and booztlet.com’s 
hypergrowth the latest year’s. the fast growth is primarily 
attributable to boozt’s strong online market position and 
its competitive customer offering, which has enabled 
boozt to attract new customers and increase the number 
of orders from returning customers. 
boozt was founded in 2007 to conduct outsourced online 
mono-brand operations for fashion brands. the group, 
in its current state, has been in operation since 2011 with 
the launch of boozt.com as a multi-brand web store on 
an in-house purpose-built platform. in the following years, 
significant investments have been made to support growth 
and increase the number of customers. in 2016, the company 
launched booztlet.com and the web store’s strategy is to 
become the leading online off-price player in the nordics.
to efficiently address the growing nordic online market 
opportunity and the target customer groups, the group 
continuously invests in future growth through its focus on
relevant marketing.
on may 31, 2017, the shares of boozt ab (publ) was listed 
on nasdaq omx stockholm (mid cap). the listing of the 
company’s shares has given the group access to the 
capital markets and has enabled the establishment of a 
diversified base of nordic and international shareholders. 
the listing was an important milestone for the group in 
the journey of becoming the primary e-commerce fashion 
retailer in the nordic region.

boozt ab / annual report 2020
director's report
on november 20, 2020 the boozt share was secondary 
listed on nasdaq omx copenhagen (mid cap). the dual-
listing was the next step in the journey and has further 
established the groups position as an Øresund company. 
further the dual listing was made to support future growth, 
provide the group with improved access to capital markets 
and establish an even more diversied shareholder base 
of new danish and international shareholders. the dual 
listing has also broadened the awareness among the 
group’s customers and suppliers. 
operations in the group are divided into three operat-
ing segments, boozt.com, booztlet.com and other. the 
boozt.com segment includes operations related to the 
boozt.com webstore. segment booztlet. com includes  
operations on the booztlet.com site, which is the group’s 
online outlet. the segment other includes the group’s 
two physical retail outlets; booztlet and the retail store 
beauty by boozt. 
boozt ab's accounts are reported in swedish kronor as 
swedish kronor is the company's functional currency. 
the report has been prepared in sek million, why there 
may be rounding differences in the totals.
financial year of 2020
comments on the consolidated income statement
net sales
for the full year of 2020 net revenue increased with 27.3% 
(23.0%) to sek 4,359.3 million (3,424.9), is attributed 
to the boozt.com and booztlet.com segments with a 
growth of 19.8% (18.5%) and 127% (133%) respectively. 
the net revenue growth was negatively impacted by 
currency effects from a strengthen sek, the change to the 
consignment-like agreement with a large brand partner 
effective in october, 2019 as well as the introduction of a 
‘fair use’ policy in november, 2019 blocking some 9,000 
customers primarily with extreme return behaviour. 
the year begun in line with expectations but with the 
corona pandemic outbreak in march, 2020 the situation 
quickly changed. mitigating activities by the governments 
to control the outbreak of the pandemic had a significantly 
impact on the overall spending on fashion and apparel, 
which impacted net revenue in march negatively. the 
group also took some safety measures in order to adopt 
to the new situation and secure that the business could 
continuing being fully operational. initially the upfront 
buys for coming autumn/winter season were trimmed 
and the group utilized the sek 200 million rcf to be in 
a strong cash position. an extraordinary write-down of 
prior season stock was made in the first quarter in order to 
reflect an expected decreased demand in fashion, which 
allowed the group to focus on selling in-season stock at 
boozt.com and give booztlet some acceleration. 
from the spring and throughout the year, the group 
experienced a tailwind from the acceleration in online 
shopping, fuelled by the corona pandemic. prerequisite 
measures taken in the beginning of the corona pandemic 
outbreak allowed the group to focus solely on the 
inseason goods on boozt.com reaching a very strong 
sell-trough and thus freeing up capacity and enabling the 
extensive buying of excess inventory from the group’s 
brand partners. the strong sell-trough during the spring 
and summer months led to a limited stock availability of 
some high performing styles caused by covid-19 related 
delays in the supply-chain during the autumn and winter, 
which was partly compensated by an unusual high share 
of campaign goods throughout the second half of the year. 
the group has welcomed more than 400,000 new active 
customers during the year and the corona pandemic 
contributed to a change in the product mix with strong 
growths within the categories men, kids, sports and 
beauty and a lower share of occasional-wear. this skewed 
product-mix, as well as the ‘fair-use’ policy implementation 
in november, 2019 contributed to a lower return-rate. 
the pattern from the last few years with sales in the apparel 
industry increasingly being driven by market events, such 
as the black friday, continued. for the group, the black 
friday weekend was again successful with strong growth 
and profitability, and a new record in number of orders 
handled per hour at the fulfilment centre.

boozt ab / annual report 2020
director's report
net revenue in the nordics increased by 28.2 % driven by 
sweden and denmark. growth in norway was negatively 
impacted by the depreciation of the nok. the increase in 
rest of europe was 16.6%, driven by booztlet’s expansion 
into new markets. 
the overall market for apparel has decreased during the 
year but the corona pandemic has accelerated the online 
penetration and permanently shifting the consumers 
towards online shopping, which is accelerating the 
structural growth towards online in the nordics. 
the other segment, including the group’s physical stores 
booztlet and beauty by boozt generated a net revenue 
of sek 25.2 million (27.7). the beauty by boozt store in 
copenhagen was closed in march, 2020 and an exit 
clause in the lease contract of the copenhagen store will 
be exercised at first opportunity in april 2021, terminating 
the lease in april 2022. for the remaining lease period, a 
temporary booztlet store is operating out of the location 
and was opened in july, 2020. a new beauty by boozt 
store was opened in emporia, malmö in june, 2020. the 
danish store’s has been closed during the spring and in 
the end of the year due to corona pandemic restrictions. 
gross profit and ebit
for the full year the gross profit increased with 30.0% to 
sek 1,769.4 million (1,361.0). the gross margin increased to 
40.6% (39.7%), which was mainly driven by a higher share 
of campaign goods, which are items bought in-season 
at lower prices, following the unusually high sell-through 
seen throughout the year fuelled by consumer spending 
changing towards online driven by the corona pandemic. 
this was partly offset by a decreased income from risk 
sharing agreement with brand partners due to a change 
in the agreement structure. during 2020 this income has 
been recognized in the end-of-season sales, meaning 
it will to a higher degree impact the first quarter 2021 
positively. 
ebit increased to sek 182.3 million (91.8) for the full year, 
while the ebit margin increased 1.5 percentage points 
to 4.2% (2.7%), driven by higher gross margin from the  
expected temporary effects from the unusual high share 
of campaign goods, as well as the improvement in all the 
operating cost ratios, especially the fulfilment cost ratio. 
during the fourth quarter the group made a write-down 
of a part of the norwegian customs receivable. the 
write-down is caused by a change in the process for 
claiming refund of customs for returns from norway at 
the norwegian tax authority. for precautionary reasons, 
a write-down of approximately sek 12 million has been 
made for a part of the customs receivable belonging to 
2019. the company still insists on its right to the claims 
towards the norwegian tax authority for this customs 
receivable. the group also issued an discretionary staff 
bonus of sek 10 million, corresponding to sek 20,000 to 
all employees, with the exception of group managment.
we have not received any covid-19 related financial sup-
port from authorities during the year.
items affecting comparability
ebit was affected by one-off costs of sek 36.6 million 
from the closing of the loss-making beauty by boozt store 
in copenhagen. the one-off costs from the closing consist 
of a write-down of the lease asset of sek 25.7 million and 
other costs of sek 10.9 million related to write-down of 
fixtures and inventory as well as terminated staff. 
 
also negatively impacting ebit is share-based payment 
attributable to the group’s long-term incentive programs 
of 64.0 million (12.4), driven by the appreciation of the 
group’s share price and listing costs of sek 7.5 million 
from the dual listing. 
adjusted for items that affecting the comparability, the 
adjusted ebit increased with 166 % to sek 290.3 (109.0). 
the adjusted ebit margin increased with 3.5 percentage 
points to 6.7 % (3.2).
108
boozt ab / annual report 2020
the group estimates that the temporary covid-19 
impacts on adjusted ebit to approximately 1.5 percentage 
points. these effects have mainly affected the improved 
gross margin through an unusually high share of campaign 
goods and a slightly lower return rate due to a changed 
product mix.
financial items
the group's financial costs amounted to sek -12.0 million 
(-10.5) and financial income amounted to sek 0.0 million 
(-0.0) for the full year. 
tax 
tax cost amounted to sek -37.6 million (-26.5) and 
consisted of a decrease in the deferred tax asset 
attributable to tax losses carried forward. the effective tax 
rate was 22.0% (32.6%), driven by deductible transaction 
costs recognised in equity, partly offset by the negative 
results made in the other segment for which no deferred 
tax asset is recognised.
net profit
the net result for the year totalled sek 132.8 million (54.8). 
earnings per share before dilution amounted to sek 2.27 
(0.96). earnings per share after dilution amounted to sek 
2.21 (0.95). 
comments on the consolidated statement  
of financial position 
working capital 
the group realised a net working capital of sek 73.8 
million (435.3) equivalent to 1.7% (12.7%) of the net revenue 
for the last twelve months. the decrease to 1.7% was 
primarily driven by a higher increase of accounts payable 
compared to inventory, which is a consequence of a higher 
sell-through of the autumn/winter 2020 items compared 
to last year and a higher share of campaign stock to keep 
up the stock level. as campaign stock are bought at high 
discount during the season, they have a positive impact 
on both inventory and accounts payables, due to the 
faster turnover for campaign stock. a lower return rate 
also has a positive impact as it decreases the inventory. 
compared to last year the prepaid expenses and 
accounts receivable has decreased since the invoicing 
of boozt media partnership has been made earlier this 
year compared to last year and the reversed norwegian 
customs receivable has decreased to approximately sek 
19 million at year-end (54).
net debt
the group realized a net debt/ -net cash of -1,006.2 
(295.6), driven by a strong cash position that increased to 
sek 1,714.5 million (339.4). the significantly change in cash 
position was driven by net proceeds, after issue expenses, 
obtained from the issuing of new shares in connection with 
the dual listing of sek 795.0 million and improved cash 
flow from operating activities. the group utilized the sek 
200 million rcf in march, 2020 which was fully repaid in 
october, 2020. the interest-bearing liabilities increased 
to sek 708.3 million (635.1), driven by the financing of the 
new autostore 4 and the new lease liability for the new 
warehouse building of sek 132.1 million, which was partly 
offset by the revaluation of lease contract for the previous 
beauty by boozt store in copenhagen and repayment of 
the previous autostore liabilities. unused credit facilities 
amounted at year-end to sek 260 million (140). for further 
information of the group’s credit facilities, see note 23. 
 
non-current assets
intangible assets increase to sek 108.6 million (75.1) and is 
attributable to capitalization of the group’s web platforms. 
tangible assets increased to sek 753.1 million (681.2). 
the increase was driven by the phase 4 expansion of 
autostore in the bfc and utilizing of the leasing contract 
for the new warehouse building on the current warehouse 
premises in Ängelholm of sek 132.1 million, partly offset 
by the reassessment of the remaining lease period and 
write-down of the beauty by boozt store in copenhagen 
performed in the first quarter. 
deferred tax assets decreased to sek 9.4 million (46.9) 
and consist of capitalised tax losses carried forward.

equity
total equity attributable to parent company shareholders 
increased to sek 1,908.1 million (942.6), driven primarily by 
the new share issue in connection with the dual listing on 
nasdaq copenhagen.
total assets and total equity and liabilities amounted to 
sek 4,031.8 (2,487.2). 
comments on the consolidated statement of cash flow
cash flow from operating activities amounted to sek 747.3 
million (76.5). the improvement compared with last year 
was driven by improved operating profit.
cash flow from changes in working capital amounted 
to sek 361.9 million (-122.4) and was mainly attributable 
to lower inventory compared to accounts payable as a 
consequence of the high sell-trough of the autumn/winter 
goods compared to last year and the unusual high share 
of campaign goods with a faster turnover rate. 
cash flow from investing activities amounted to sek 
-150.8 million (-171.3), driven by the phase 4 expansion of 
autostore and capitalization of the group’s web platforms. 
cash flow from financing activities amounted to sek 779.4 
million (66.1) and was mainly attributable to proceeds 
obtained from the issue of new shares in connection with 
the dual listing in copenhagen, whereby the group raised 
sek 825.6 million before deduction of cost of new share 
issue of sek 30.7 million. other cash flow from financing 
activities comprising of proceeds obtained from share 
capital increase through exercise of the lti program 
2015/2025 of sek 22.6 million, new loans of sek 289.3 
million and loan repayments of sek -279.7 million, where 
the sek 200 million where both utilized and fully repaid

dividend policy 
when free cash flow exceeds available investments 
in profitable growth, the surplus can be distributed to 
shareholders. the company does not intend to pay 
dividends in the medium term and there can be no 
assurances that in any given year a dividend will be 
paid. declaration of dividends, if any, and the amounts 
and timing thereof, will depend on a number of factors, 
including financial position, investment needs, acquisition 
opportunities, general economic and business conditions 
and such other factors as the board of directors may deem 
relevant in such a decision.
the board of directors propose to the annual general 
meeting 2021 that no dividends are paid to the sharehold-
ers for the financial year 2020.

boozt ab / annual report 2020
boozt works continuously to identify, assess and evaluate risks to which the group is 
currently exposed to, and risks that are probable to occur in the foreseeable future. risks 
are identified, assessed and managed based on the group’s vision and goals. the group 
uses the following categories to manage risks; financial-, strategic-, operational- and 
compliance risks. 
operational risks are continuously evaluated within daily operations. management-related 
risks are continuously reviewed by management and documented by the internal control 
function. group management reports monthly to the board of directors on potential risk 
issues. the board of directors is responsible to the shareholders for the group’s risk 
management and formally assess risks annually or more often when needed. 
identified risks are assessed regarding the probability of occurrence and impact if occurring. 
the effectiveness of existing risk responses (such as safeguards, control activities etc.) is 
qualitatively assessed. the residual risk is illustrated and considers the effectiveness of all 
current existing risk responses. all identified risks are documented in a risk map and further 
explained in a risk register, internally called boozt risk library. 
risks can be mitigated through proactive actions, such as insurances or legal agreements, 
and in some cases, the group can influence the likelihood of a risk-related event occurring. 
other risks are not possible to eliminate, such as risks dependent on political decisions, 
or other macroeconomic factors. if a risk is related to events beyond the control of the 
company, work is aimed at alleviating the consequences. 
overview of identified risks 
in the following section, we report the identified risks which are considered to have a 
considerable impact on the business as per april 2021. we have evaluated the risk picture 
considering the impact of the current economic uncertainty as a consequence of the 
ongoing coronavirus pandemic. although there is considerable uncertainty on this impact, 
we believe that risk 2, risk 4, risk 9 and risk 17 is affected by the situation. 
in the boozt risk library, we have identified over a hundred risks, however several of 
them have a relative low risk of occurrence or low possible impact, and therefore are not 
included in the reported risks. the relative possibility of occurrence and impact if occurring 
of the risk changes over time, meaning that the reported risks are to be seen as a snapshot 
of current risks. the group discloses the top 20 risk list in a non-prioritised order. the list 
can differ from year to year as some risks might increase in probability or appear for the 
first time and others might be less probable or is downgraded due to mitigating activities.

financial risks
financial risks include risks that effects the business ability to provide the business with sufficient funding and liquidity  
to operate and develop the business according to business plan. see note 28 for more information. 
risk 
1. re-financing risks
risk regarding ability to provide the group with sufficient funding 
with respect to growth plans and access to capital markets/bank 
institutions.
rating: decreased impact and probability compared to last year.
2. liquidity reserve risk
risk that the group does not have a sufficient liquidity reserve due 
to inefficient cash management planning or un-expected events with 
heavy cash-flow implications.
rating: unchanged compared to last year.
3. credit risk 
risk of credit losses arising from the group´s financial receivables due 
to the group’s counterparties failure to comply with their commitments.
rating: re-phrased from accounts receivable. decreased impact and 
decreased probability compared to last year.
4. currency risk
exchange rate fluctuations may affect the translation of the group’s 
transactional net exposure in foreign currencies negatively.
rating: unchanged since last year.
mitigation of risk
1. re-financing risks
the risk is mitigated by adopted policies regarding target debt 
ratios, maturity date spreads for funding of the group and a risk 
diversification policy regarding financial counterparties (e.g. minimum 
number of banks). 
2. liquidity reserve risk
the group faces two seasonality low points in liquidity per fiscal year. 
the group shall strive to have a sufficient liquidity reserve. prices for 
inventories are set when placing orders but paid when received, which 
gives sufficient time to plan cash management. during low- points the 
group has access to a revolving credit facility and an overdraft facility to 
ensure a sufficient liquidity reserve. the reserve also serves to mitigate 
the impact of general macroeconomic uncertainty and operational 
disturbances. 
3. credit risk 
the group use several payment providers and receive payments from 
these within a couple of days why the credit time is limited. the group 
takes no credit risk when customers use invoice payment. accounts 
receivables held is towards the group’s brand partners, of which the 
group regularly conduct purchases from and have a liability towards. 
4. currency risk
the transactional exposure is managed primarily through natural 
hedges, meaning that procurement is carried out in the same currency 
as inflow from revenue. the group constantly evaluates if currency 
hedges shall be enforced.

with the group’s curated offering, positioned to stay relevant to the 
modern nordic fashion follower, we believe that our competitive 
advantage is strong. we have high awareness within our target group 
and continue to differentiate ourselves by creating customer loyalty 
through a curated nordic offering based on analysis and data as well as 
convenience through ease and speed of our offering to the customers.
7 & 8 personnel
the group seeks to be an attractive employer by a competitive offering 
both in terms of salary and benefits, but also by creating a culture that our 
employees enjoy being a part of. in our code of conduct, we state the 
values that we want the business to live by. 
9. overall economic risks 
the group actively monitor macroeconomic trends and development 
within the region that we operate in, as well as the online factors and 
trends that may affect the sector in which we operate. to mitigate impact 
of a demand shock we focus on having as few fixed costs as possible 
to make the cost base variable to the revenue. and then we focus on 
preserving cash in the balance sheet by measures such as reducing the 
working capital exposure.
10. reputational risk 
proper treatment of employees (participation in collective bargaining 
agreement) and excess employees in the form of cash remuneration 
and outplacement. in relation to brands, we align performance to secure 
long lasting relationships. in relation to customers, we constantly monitor 
satisfaction and live by the notion – “if any doubt – the customer is right”.
11. acquisitions
the group will not pursue an acquisition in unrelated areas, expand the 
core business outside the nordic or put the current unit economics in 
risk. a strategic bolt-on will be made to gain access to specific category 
expertise, gain access to new technology or increase the group’s 
current presence in the nordic market.

boozt ab / annual report 2020
consolidated financial statements
these annual accounts and consolidated accounts include 
the swedish parent company boozt ab, corporate identity 
number 556793-5183, and its subsidiaries. the group's main 
business is sale of fashion, kids, home, sport and beauty.
the parent company boozt ab (publ) (registration number 
556793-5183) is a swedish public limited liability company 
registered in sweden domiciled in malmö. the head office 
address is hyllie boulevard 35, 215 37 malmö.
the board of directors and the ceo has on april 16, 2021 
approved the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
which will be submitted for adoption at the annual general 
meeting on may 27, 2021. 
applied rules and regulations
the consolidated accounts have been prepared in 
accordance with the swedish annual accounts act and 
international financial reporting standards (ifrs) issued 
by the international accounting standards board (iasb) 
as defined by the european union (eu). in addition, the 
consolidated accounts follow the recommendation of the 
rfr 1 "supplementary accounting rules for groups". 
new or amended accounting standards  
and interpretations 
the ongoing reference interest rate reform, which means 
that the existing reference interest rates ibor, will be 
replaced by alternative risk-free interest rates. as part of the 
reference interest rate reform, changes have been made 
to ifrs 9 and ifrs 7. these changes will take place in two 
phases, where phase 1 is applicable from 1 january 2020.
boozt is mainly exposed to ibor through existing external 
borrowing and to other reference interest rates such 
as euribor, libor, nibor and cibor via the group's 
available credit facility.
phase 1 is primarily linked to hedge accounting and thus 
had no effect as the group did not apply any hedge 
accounting during 2020.
other new or revised accounting standards and interpre-
tations that were adopted in 2020 have not had any signif-
icant impact on the group's financial reporting for 2020.
currency
functional currency is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which companies operate. the 
parent company's functional currency is sek, which is also 
the reporting currency for the parent company and the 
group. this means that the financial reports are presented 
in sek. all amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are 
rounded to the nearest million with one decimal. 
consolidation
subsidiaries
subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has 
control. the group has control of a subsidiary when 
it is exposed to or has the right to variable returns from 
its holdings in the company and has the opportunity to 
impact the return, through its influence in the company. 
subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the 
control is transferred to the group. they are excluded 
from the consolidated accounts from the date when the 
control ceases. acquisitions are accounted for using the 
purchase method. the method implies that the acquisition 
of a subsidiary is considered a transaction through which 
the group indirectly acquires the subsidiary's assets and 
assumes its liabilities. the acquisition analysis/purchase 
price allocation establishes the fair value at the acquisition 
date of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed and any non-controlling interests.
transaction costs, except for transaction costs that are 
attributable to the issuance of equity or debt instruments, 
are recognised immediately in the income statement for the 
year. for acquisitions where the consideration transferred 
exceeds the fair value of acquired assets and assumed 
liabilities that are recognised separately, the difference is 
recognised as goodwill. when the difference is negative, 
known as a bargain acquisition, this is recognised directly 
in the income statement for the year. 
transactions eliminated in consolidation
group internal receivables and liabilities, revenues or costs 
and unrealised gains or losses relating to group internal 
transactions between group companies are eliminated 
when the group's accounts are consolidated. 
note 1 - significant accounting principles
128
boozt ab / annual report 2020
consolidated financial statements
classification
fixed assets and long-term liabilities essentially consist of 
amounts expected to be recovered or settled after more 
than twelve months from the statement of financial position 
date. current assets and current liabilities essentially 
consist of amounts expected to be recovered or settled 
within twelve months from the statement of financial 
position date.
segment reporting
an operating segment is a component of the group that 
conducts operations from which it can generate revenues 
and incur costs and for which independent information is 
available. operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 
chief executive decision-maker (board of directors) to 
allocate resources to the operating segment. boozt  
has identified and reports three operating segments; 
boozt.com, booztlet.com and other.
the assumptions and key ratios for allocating resources to 
the operating segments have been consistent over time. 
for reporting by segment, see note 4. 
transactions in foreign currency
transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the 
transaction date. monetary assets and liabilities in foreign 
currencies are translated into the functional currency at 
the exchange rate prevailing at the statement of financial 
position date. exchange rate differences arising on 
translation are recognised in the income statement for the 
year. exchange gains and losses on operating receivables 
and liabilities are recognised in operating profit/loss, while 
gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities are 
reported as financial items. 
translation of foreign operations
assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including 
goodwill and other group surpluses and deficits, are 
translated from their functional currency to the group's 
reporting currency, swedish kronor, at the exchange 
rate prevailing on the statement of financial position 
date. revenues and expenses of foreign operations are 
translated to swedish kronor at an average rate that is 
an approximation of the exchange rates prevailing on 
the transaction dates. translation differences arising 
on translation of foreign operations are recognised as 
comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate 
component in equity called translation reserve. on 
loss of control due to disposal of a foreign operation, 
the cumulative translation differences relating to the 
activities are realised, whereby they are reclassified from 
comprehensive income to the income statement for the 
year. 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized in line with ifrs 15 revenue from 
contracts with customers. a revenue is recognised when 
the control of the product passes to the customer or the 
service is provided in accordance with the agreement, 
its amount can be measured in a reliable manner and the 
future economic benefit is likely to accrue to the group. 
recognised revenue is equivalent with the expected 
economic compensation where adjustment has been 
made for the performance obligations boozt is obliged to 
comply with in accordance to contractual commitments, as 
discount and return obligations. 
sale of goods
boozt identifies its performance obligations within sale of 
goods when the goods has been delivered from the boozt 
fulfillment centre. all sales are made on a 30-day return. 
revenue recognised is reduced with the transactional 
price (excl. vat) for the items that are expected to be 
returned. the reduced amounts are accounted for as 
a refund liability for returns and complaints. the refund 
liability is classified as accrued expenses and the goods 
expected to be returned is classified as inventories. 
the expected return is based on historical sales statistics 
and an assessment of future complaints and returns, and 
occurs in the same period as the sale.
commission sales
when the group sells goods or services as an agent, 
revenue and payments to suppliers are recognised net 
under net revenue and represent the margin/commission 
earned by the group. the group is liable for any value 
added tax on the total value of items sold to end consumers. 
129
boozt ab / annual report 2020
consolidated financial statements
the group recognises actual and expected returns in the 
same manner as for sale of goods. whether the group is 
considered as principal or agent in a transaction is based 
on an analysis of both the legal form and the content of the 
agreement between the group and its business partner, 
these assessments affect the amount of recognised net 
sales and operating expenses, but not profit/loss for the 
year or cash flows.
gift cards
upon the sale of gift cards the entire amount is recognised 
as a liability and is recognised as revenue when the gift 
card is used, or when its validity expires. for gift cards with 
a non-expiry date, the group recognises revenue when it's 
likely to not be utilized. 
sale of marketing services
for sale of marketing services, a revenue is recognised 
from the brand partners that the group sell marketing 
services to. the net revenue is recognised when the 
services are performed where the company has fulfilled its 
obligation to the brand partner. the services are normally 
invoiced in advance why the company recognizes an 
accrued income in the statement of financial position. 
employee benefits
current benefits
current employee benefits such as salary, social security 
contributions, holiday pay and bonus are expensed in the 
period when the employees provide the services. 
pensions
the group’s pension obligations are covered by defined 
contribution plans. a defined contribution plan is a pension 
plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into 
a separate external party. the group has no legal or 
informal obligations to pay further contributions if this legal 
entity does not have sufficient assets to pay all employee 
benefits relating to employee services in the current and 
prior periods. the group has therefore no additional 
risk. the group's obligations for contributions to defined 
contribution plans are recognised as an expense in profit/
loss for the year as they are earned by the employee 
performing services for the group during a period. 
compensation on termination
an expense for remuneration in connection with 
termination of personnel is recognised only if the company 
is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility 
of withdrawal, by a formal detailed plan to terminate an 
employment before the normal dismissal time. when 
remuneration is paid as an offer to encourage voluntary 
redundancy, a cost is recognised if it is probable that the 
offer will be accepted and the number of employees who 
will accept the offer can be reliably estimated. 
share-based payments
key employees, including senior executives are invited to 
participate in long-term incentive programs in boozt ab. 
the group has three ongoing equity settled programs 
classified as share-based payment under ifrs 2. 
lti program 2015/2025 gives the participants right to 
convert an vested option to twelve ordinary shares at a 
pre-determined price if the option holder is still in service at 
the end of each vesting period in the program. lti program 
2019/2022 and lti program 2020/2023 are based on 
performance shares, where the participants will receive 
shares in the company at a subscription price of sek 0.00 
when the vesting period ends if certain performance 
measures are met at the end of the performance period. 
costs for share-based payment are recognised as the 
value of services received, allocated over the vesting 
periods for the plans, calculated as the fair value of the 
allotted equity instruments. the fair value is determined 
on the grant-date, the date the lti program was approved 
by the general meeting. non-market criteria’s included in 
the performance criteria’s are valued at the actual share 
price at the grant date and the value of market criteria´s are 
determined by applying valuation technique, such as black 
& scholes or a monte carlo simulation. no recalculation of 
the fair value is made. 
since the programs are equity settled, the corresponding 
amount to the recognised cost are recognised in equity 
within other capital contributions. the recognised cost is 
based on the number of shares that are expected to be 
issued when the vesting period ends. the cost for the 
expected shares is accrued over the vesting period. the 
130
boozt ab / annual report 2020
recognized costs are adjusted on each reporting period 
if the expected number of shares that are expected to 
be vested are changed during the vesting period due to 
changed assumptions of expected employee retention 
and expected achievement of the performance criteria’s.  
non-market condition’s, such as service condition or 
certain performance targets are adjusted according 
to the actual outcome of the program when the vesting 
period ends. market conditions are recognised as costs 
regardless of whether the specific market condition is met. 
social security contributions on the employee benefit 
value are expensed and accrued over the vesting period. 
the social security provision is based on the estimated 
number of shares that have been vested at each reporting 
date and is recalculated to the actual market price of the 
company’s share. costs for changed share price are 
recognised in the current period. 
for further information of the group’s share-based pay-
ments, see note 9. 
leases
the group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, 
a lease at the beginning of the contract. the group 
recognizes a right of use asset and a corresponding lease 
liability for all leases in which the group is lessee, except 
for shortterm leases (leases with a leasing period of a 
maximum of 12 months) and for leases where the underlying 
asset is of low value (approximately sek 50,000). 
for lease contracts that meet the criteria for the relief rules, 
the group recognizes leasing fees as a straightline operat-
ing cost over the lease period, unless another systematic 
method of accruing the lease fee gives a more accurate 
picture of how the economic benefits from the underlying 
asset are consumed by the lessee. 
the lease liability is initially valued at the present value 
of future lease payments that have not been paid at the 
commencement date of the lease, discounted with the 
implicit interest rate, or if this cannot be easily determined, 
the group's marginal loan interest rate. the loan interest 
rate is the interest rate that a lessee would have to pay 
for financing through loans during a corresponding period, 
and with similar collateral, for the right of use of an asset in 
a similar economic environment.
lease payments included in the valuation of lease liabilities 
include the following;
• fixed fees (including in-substance fixed fees), after 
deduction of any benefits in connection with the 
signing of the lease to be obtained; 
• variable fees that depend on an index or price initially 
valued using the index or price at the commencement 
date; 
• amounts expected to be paid by the lessee under 
residual value guarantees; 
• the exercise price for an option to buy if the lessee 
is reasonably sure to take advantage of such an 
opportunity; and 
• penalty fees that are payable upon termination of the 
lease agreement, if the lease period reflects that the 
lessee will use an opportunity to terminate the lease. 
lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in 
the statement of financial position. lease liabilities are 
recognised in the subsequent period by increasing the 
debt to reflect the effect of interest and reducing it to 
reflect the effect of lease payments made. lease liabilities 
are revalued with a corresponding adjustment of the right 
of use according to the rules found in the standard. 
the rights of use asset are initially recognized at the value of 
the lease liability, with the addition of lease payments made 
on or before the commencement date of the lease and initial 
direct expenses. the right of use asset is recognised in 
the subsequent period at cost less depreciation and write-
downs. if the group incurs obligations for dismantling of a 
leased asset, restoration of land or restoration and renovation 
of access to condition agreed in a contract, a provision for 
such obligations is reported in accordance with ias 37. right 
of use assets are depreciated over the estimated useful life 
or, if shorter, over the agreed lease term. if a lease transfers 
ownership at the end of the lease period or if the acquisition 
value includes a probable exercise of a call option, the right 
of use is depreciated over the useful life.
consolidated financial statements
131
boozt ab / annual report 2020
depreciation begins on the commencement date of the 
lease. right of use assets are presented on a separate 
line in the report on financial position with specification 
in note 8. the group applies the principles in ias 36 for 
impairment of rights to use assets and reports this in the 
same way as described in the principles for impairment of 
non-financial assets.
variable lease payments that do not depend on an 
index or price are not included in the valuation of lease 
liabilities and right of use assets. such lease payments are 
recognised as an expense in operating profit in the period 
in which they arise. 
for further information about the group’s leases, see note 
8. 
financial income and costs 
finance income comprises of interest income on funds 
invested and financial instruments that are measured 
through profit or loss.
financial expenses comprise interest expenses on 
borrowings and losses on financial instruments measured 
at fair value through profit or loss. from 2019, interest 
expenses for leases are recognised as a financial expense 
due to the implementation of ifrs 16 leases. 
income taxes
reported tax comprises current tax and deferred tax. income 
tax is recognised in profit or loss unless the underlying 
transaction is recognised in other comprehensive income 
or in equity, whereby the associated tax effect is recognised 
in other comprehensive income or in equity. current tax is 
tax to be paid or received for the current year, using tax 
rates enacted or substantially enacted at the statement 
of financial position date. current tax also includes 
adjustments of current tax attributable to previous periods. 
deferred tax is recognised in full, using the statement of 
financial position method, on all temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts. temporary differences attributable 
to participations in subsidiaries and associated companies 
that are not expected to be reversed in the foreseeable 
future are not considered. 
the valuation of deferred tax is based on how underlying 
assets or liabilities are expected to be realised or settled. 
deferred tax is calculated by applying the tax rates and tax 
rules enacted or announced at the statement of financial 
position date and are expected to apply when the related 
deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred in-
come tax liability is settled. deferred tax assets for deduct-
ible temporary differences and tax losses carried forward 
are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
they can be utilised. the value of deferred tax assets is re-
duced when it is no longer considered probable that they 
can be utilised. 
intangible assets
web platform
development expenditure for new or improved processes 
within the group's web platform designed for e-commerce 
is recognised as an asset in the statement of financial 
position if the process is technically and commercially 
feasible and the group has sufficient resources to complete 
the process. capitalised expenses relates to software and 
software platform. resources to capitalised proprietary 
software such as fastlane, propilot, partner portal, cseye 
and booztfinance is allocated via an allocation formula 
based on the number of code lines produced by the 
group’s developers.
amortization principles 
amortization is recognised in profit/loss of the year on a 
straight-line basis over the depreciable intangible assets' 
estimated useful lives. 
• the estimated useful lives are; 
• web platform 5 years 
• the useful lives are reviewed at least annually. 
goodwill
goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. goodwill is allocated to cash-
generating units and tested at least once a year for potential 
impairment as no goodwill amortization is made. goodwill 
represents the difference between the acquisition value 
and the fair value of acquired assets, assumed liabilities 
and possible liabilities. goodwill in foreign currency is 
recalculated on each reporting date.
consolidated financial statements
132
boozt ab / annual report 2020
tangible assets
tangible assets are recognised at acquisition cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. 
the cost includes the purchase price and expenses 
directly attributable to the asset to bring it in place and 
in condition to be used in accordance with the purpose 
of the acquisition. the carrying amount of an asset is 
derecognised from the statement of financial position on 
disposal or sale or when no future economic benefits are 
expected from the use or disposal/ sale of the asset.
gain or loss arising on the disposal or disposal of an asset 
is the difference between the sale price and the asset's 
carrying amount less direct selling expenses. gains and 
losses are recognised as other operating income/ expenses. 
subsequent expenditure
subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the asset will 
flow to the group and the acquisition cost can be measured 
in a reliable way. all other subsequent expenditure is 
expensed in the period they occur. repairs are expensed 
continuously. 
depreciation principles
depreciation is made on a straight-line basis over the 
asset's estimated useful life.
the estimated useful lives are; 
• equipment, tools, fixtures and fittings: 5 years 
• computers: 3 years 
• aluminium grids and boxes in automated storage 
system, autostore: 10 years 
depreciation methods, residual values and useful lives 
are reassessed at each year-end. 
impairment of non-financial assets
assets that are depreciated are assessed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. an impairment 
loss is the amount by which the asset's carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. the recoverable amount 
is the higher of an asset's fair value less selling expenses 
and value in use. when assessing impairment, assets are 
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). when 
impairment has been identified for a cash-generating unit 
(group of units) the impairment loss is primarily allocated 
to goodwill. thereafter, a proportional impairment of other 
assets in the unit (group of units) is made. the previously 
recognised impairment loss is reversed if the recoverable 
amount is estimated to exceed the carrying value. 
however, reversal must only be made with an amount so 
that the carrying value amounts to what it would have been 
if the impairment had not been recognised in previous 
periods. impairment of goodwill is never reversed though. 
financial instruments 
a financial asset or financial liability is recognised in the 
statement of financial position when the group becomes 
a party to the instrument's contractual terms. financial 
instruments include cash and cash equivalent, deposit, 
accounts receivable, interest bearing receivable, accounts 
payable, derivate and borrowing. account receivables 
are recognised when invoices are sent to the customer. 
since a receivable relating to consumer transactions are 
transferred to a credit institution at the time of the customers' 
transaction, no account receivable is recognized. instead 
the receivable is classified as other receivable until the 
credit institution makes the payment. when a consumer 
use invoice as payment method, instead of direct debit, 
the group sell the receivable to a financial institute. the 
transactional cost for the selling of the accounts receivable 
is recognised as an external operating cost. liabilities 
are recognised when the counterparty has performed, 
and there is a contractual obligation to pay, even if an 
invoice not yet has been received. account payables are 
recognised when invoices are received.
a financial asset is derecognised in the statement of 
financial position when the contractual rights are realised, 
expire or the group loses control over them. the same 
applies to part of a financial asset. a financial liability is 
derecognised in the statement of financial position when 
the obligation in the agreement is fulfilled or otherwise 
settled. the same applies to part of a financial liability. 
financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net 
amount is recognised in the statement of financial position 
only when there is a legal right to offset the amounts and 
there is an intention to settle the items on a net basis or to 
realise the asset and at the same time settle the liability. 
consolidated financial statements
133
boozt ab / annual report 2020
the group has not offset any asset and liabilities in the 
statement of financial position as of december 31, 2020. 
purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on 
the trade date. trade date is the day when the company 
commits to acquire or sell the asset.
classification and valuation of financial instruments 
financial instruments are initially recognised at acquisition 
cost, corresponding to fair value of the instrument plus 
transaction costs for all financial instruments except for 
those classified as financial assets/liabilities recognised 
via income statement, which are recognised at fair value 
excluding transaction costs. a financial instrument is 
classified on initial recognition among others based on 
the group’s business model and purpose for which it was 
acquired and its contractual cash flow. the classification 
determines how the financial instrument is valued after the 
initial recognition.
financial instuments are classified based on the 
following categories: 
• financial assets or liabilities valued at amortised cost 
• financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value via 
income statement. 
• financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income 
financial instruments valued at amortised cost 
the group valued financial instruments at amortised cost 
in the following categories; 
• financial assets 
• financial liabilities 
• cash and cash equivalents 
financial assets 
financial assets are financial assets that are not derivatives, 
that have fixed or determinable payments and that are 
not listed in an active market. these assets are valued 
at accrued acquisition cost. accrued acquisition cost is 
determined using the effective interest rate calculated at 
the acquisition date. receivables are recognised at the 
amount expected to be received i.e. after deductions for 
bad debts. 
other financial liabilities
loans and other financial liabilities such as accounts 
payables are included in this category. amortised cost 
refers to the amount at which liability measured is initially 
recognised net of amortisation and impairment losses as 
well as additions for the accrual of the initial amount and 
the maturity amount at amortised cost. other financial 
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method.
cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash deposited 
through banks and similar financial institutions. it may occur 
that parts are restricted. for more information see note 20. 
financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value via 
income statement
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
may consist of derivatives and liabilities for purchase 
consideration. financial instruments valued at fair value 
via the income statement are classified according to the 
fair value hierarchy as follows:
• listed prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities (level 1),
• other observable input data for the asset or liability 
than listed prices included in level 1, either directly (i.e. 
as price quotations) or indirectly (i.e. derived from price 
quotations) (level 2),
• input for the asset or liability that is not based on 
observable market data (i.e. non-observable input data) 
(level 3). 
more information of fair value can be found in note 28.
the group has no financial instrument measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive income. 
provision for credit losses
a provision for expected credit loss is recognised for all 
financial assets other than financial assets measured at fair 
value via income statement. the group has applied the 
simplified approach for calculation of expected credit loss 
on the group's trade receivables. at each reporting date, in 
addition to a provision for individual estimates, a provision 
corresponding to expected credit losses for the remaining 
consolidated financial statements
134
boozt ab / annual report 2020
maturity period of the asset is recognised which reduces 
the value of the asset. the expected credit loss is based on 
estimates built upon the group´s knowledge and historical 
information about similar assets or counterparties together 
with present circumstances, potential future events, fore-
cast for future financial conditions and the time value of 
money. the assessments are done on both a collective and 
individual basis. the underlying criteria and assumptions 
are evaluated on a continuous basis to reflect the current 
situation. boozt defines credit deteriorated as the fact that 
it is considered unlikely that the counterparty will meet its 
obligations due to indicators such as financial difficulties 
and non-payment. regardless, default is considered to 
exist when the payment is 180 days late. financial assets  
are together with coherent credit loss provisions 
derecognised from the statement of financial position when 
there aren’t any expectations of future recovery, remaining 
collateral or all right to collections has been settled. 
impairment of trade receivables and other receivables is 
reported as operating expenses. impairment of cash and 
cash equivalents and other long-term securities holdings 
is reported as a financial expense.
for cash and cash equivalents with a maturity of less 
than 12 months, the general model is assumed with the 
assumption of low credit risk. also receivables from joint 
ventures / associated companies, other receivables, 
receivables from group companies and accrued income is 
covered by the general model.
placement of liquid assets may only be made in banks or 
credit institutions with a high credit rating in accordance 
with the group's treasury policy. historically, there have 
never been any customer losses regarding cash and cash 
equivalents, and it is also not considered likely that this 
will occur in the future. for more information of the group's 
financial instruments, see note 19-24 and note 28.
inventories
inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition cost 
and net realisable value. acquisition cost is calculated 
under the so-called first-in first-out principle and includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and 
bringing them to their present location and condition. net 
realisable value is defined as the selling price less selling 
expenses.
inventories are exposed to obsolescence. factors that 
affect the risk of obsolescence includes among others 
the risk that returned goods are unsaleable and risk of 
redundancy. 
the group made seasonal write-downs twice a year when 
prior year season goods are written-down during a six 
month’s period, meaning the items are fully written-down 
after eighteen months. written-down items are primarily 
sold at the group's offprice web shop booztlet.com or 
at booztlet’s physical outlet before they eventually are 
discarded. 
contingent liabilities
a contingent liability is recognised when there is a 
possible obligation that arises from past events and whose 
existence is confirmed only by one or more uncertain future 
events or when there is one or several commitments that 
are not recognised as a liability or provision because it is 
not probable that an outflow of resources will be required. 
earnings per share
the calculation of earnings per share is based on 
consolidated net profit attributable to the parent company 
shareholders and on the weighted average number of 
shares outstanding during the year. when calculation 
earnings per share after dilution, the average number 
of shares outstanding is adjusted with potential dilutive 
effects of potential ordinary shares. outstanding options 
and performance shares from the group’s equity settled 
long-term incentive programs are dilutive to the extent 
they are likely to be vested. options held in own custody 
from lti program 2015/2025 have not been included in 
earnings per share after dilution. 
warrants under lti program 2018/2021 are not classified 
as an equity settled instrument under ifrs 2, but gives 
the warrant holders an unconditional right to buy ordinary 
shares at a predetermined price. the outstanding warrants 
are dilutive when the market share price exceeds the 
exercise price.

estimates and assumptions
preparation of the financial reports in accordance with ifrs 
requires management to make assessments and estimates 
and assumptions that affect application of the accounting 
policies and the recognised amounts of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses. actual results may differ from these 
estimates. estimates and assumptions are continually 
evaluated. changes in estimates are recognised in the 
period the change is made if the change only affected that 
period or in the period the change is made and in future 
periods if the change affects both current and future periods. 
leasing
when reporting leases under ifrs 16 estimates and 
judgements are made in the terms of the possibility and 
coherent probability to exercising extending options, 
termination of contracts, estimated useful life of a lease 
that is extended on an ongoing basis if neither party 
actively terminates the lease and actual expected useful 
life of the lease asset. boozt has estimated the useful life 
of a lease in line with the underlying contract. the largest 
lease contract, which constitutes approximately 70% of 
the value of the group’s leases is the premises for the 
fulfillment centre in Ängelholm which runs for 13 years. 
reservation of returns 
the estimate on expected returns is based on historical 
statistical information on the return percentage on sales. 
the group´s standard term is a 30-days return period. 
estimations are monitored and deviations are investigated 
monthly. as of the closing date, the provision for expected 
returns amounts to sek 176.7 million classified as accrued 
expenses and prepaid income and a receivable of sek 
114.6 million classified as inventory. 
deferred tax
for the group, deferred tax assets are fully attributable to 
losses carried forward. the deferred tax asset is recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will 
be available against which the accumulated deficits can be 
utilised. the group's tax losses carried forward are attribut-
able to sweden, where losses carried forward are not time 
limited. it is the group's assessment that the coming year will 
generate taxable income to the extent that the losses carried 
forward can be utilised. at the reporting date, the group’s 
deferred tax asset amounted to sek 9.4 million (46.9). 
inventory obsolescence 
inventories are recognised at the lower of acquisition 
cost and net realisable value. when calculating the net 
realisable value, an assumption is made of outgoing items, 
surplus items, damaged goods and the estimated sales 
value based on available information. 
more information can be found in note 18. 
share based payments
for lti program 2019/2022 and lti program 2020/2023, a 
probability assessment of reaching the pre-defined targets 
and fulfil the terms and condition for achieving a grant of 
performance share is performed at each reporting date. 
the assessments are thereby a factor in the calculation of 
the liability (social charges) for share based payments to 
employees for the period. 
at the reporting date, with current estimates on achieve-
ment of the performance targets and employee retention 
rate, the group considers 136,377 performance shares from 
lti program 2019/2022 to have been vested and 138,660 
performance shares from the lti program 2020/2023. 
lti program 2015/2025 has been fully vested during 
the year and the group has recognised all ifrs 2 costs 
attributable to the options vested. a social provision 
remains for outstanding options held by employees that 
have not yet been exercised.  
more information regarding the group’s long-term 
incentive program can be found in note 9.
legal proceedings
in accordance with ifrs, a liability is recognised when 
there is an obligation as a result of an event and it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the 
amount can be made. a regular review is made of the 
outstanding legal cases. an assessment is then made 
of the need for provisions in the financial reports. the 
group companies are only involved in minor disputes 
that are directly attributable to the business. appropriate 
provisions are made when the assessment resulted in a 
risk. as per december 31, 2020 no liabilities related to 
legal proceedings are accounted for.

note 2 - accounting standards that the group will adopt  
as from january 1, 2021 
phase 2 of the amendments to ifrs 9, ifrs 7 and others applies to the reference interest rate reform from january 1, 2021. 
in short, the amendments mean that it enables companies to reflect the effects of the transition from reference interest 
rates to other reference interest rates without giving rise to accounting effects that would not provide useful information to 
users of financial reports. the group is affected by the reference interest rate reform mainly due to exposure to ibor in its 
external borrowing as hedge accounting is not applied. exposure to ibor is limited and the company monitors the changes 
and their impact.
other new and revised standards and interpretations that come into force for financial years beginning after january 1, 2021 
are not considered to have a significant impact on the group's financial reporting.

after evaluating the beauty by boozt physical retail operation, an exit clause in the lease contract of the copenhagen store 
will be exercised at first opportunity in april 2021, terminating the lease in april 2022. the reassessment of the lease contract 
resulted in a change of the remaining lease period reducing the right-of-use asset and lease liability with sek 44.4 million. 
following the revaluation of the contract an impairment test of the contract was performed leading to a write-down of the 
remaining value of the asset of sek 25.7 million. in december, the new fulfilment centre building in Ängelholm was handed 
over from catena. the agreement length is set to twelve years and the impact on the financial position was sek 132.1 million.

tion price of sek 96.31, corresponding to 126 percent of 
the volume weighted average price according to nasdaq 
stockholm's official pricelist for shares in the company

the group's goodwill is related to the acquisition of touchlogic aps in october, 2019.
the acquisition was made in order to gain the technical competence of the entire staff and strengthen boozt's competence 
within the interface that meets customer (frontend) in apps and on mobile websites. then, touchlogic has been transformed 
into boozt innovation lab, a separate unit that only works with internal development projects to meet customers and 
partners' increased expectations and to improve internal workflows. hence, boozt innovation lab has no external revenue 
and the technology and development created are used at the group's websites boozt.com and booztlet.com, why boozt 
innovation lab is an important part of the group's future development and in order to achieve the financial targets stated 
in the director's report on pages 113-114. in 2020, full compensation was paid for the contingent purchase consideration for 
2020, which was based on development and performance targets in technical development and competence, hence no 
indication of impairment of goodwill has been identified as of december 31, 2020.

goods for resale amount to 2,589.9 (2,063.9) for the year. write-downs of inventory items has been made for a total of sek 
110.0 million (39.9), which has been recognised as goods for resale in the income statement. in march, 2020 at the outbreak 
of the corona pandemic the group took some precautionary measures and did a extraordinay write-down of prior season 
goods of sek 57.8 million. the write-down was a consequence of the then expected subdued demand for the remainder of 
the year. the write-down related primarily to the spring/summer 19 stock, but also selected parts of the pre-autumn/winter 
19 stock. with the subdued demand expected, the purpose for the extraordinary write-down was to focus on the in-season 
stock on boozt.com and give booztlet.com the opportunity to sell the written down items at a possible higher margin. 
normally, prior season items would have a second chance to sell in line with the group's write-down principles of writing 
everything down after 18 months as described in note 1. written-down items are in primarily sold at the group's offprice 
webbshop booztlet.com before they eventually are recycled.

consolidated financial statements
the group's business is exposed to various financial risks; 
currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity 
risk. the group's overall risk management strategy is 
focused on managing uncertainty in the financial markets 
and strives to minimise potential adverse effects on the 
group's financial results. 
the group has developed a risk management framework 
in order to strengthen risk management in the group. the 
framework establishes how risks are identified, assessed 
and monitored. the board of directors has decided on 
the general principles that applies to the management of 
financial risks through the adopted treasury policy. the 
treasury policy mainly covers the following areas; capital 
structure, capital raising, debt financing and liquidity man-
agement. the key financial risks are described below. 
currency risk
currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash 
flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes 
in foreign exchange rates. the main exposure is derived 
from the group's sales and purchases in foreign currencies. 
this exposure is called transactional exposure. currency 
risks also exist in the translation of foreign operations' 
assets and liabilities into the parent company's functional 
currency, known as translational exposure. the translational 
exposure for the group is limited. according to the group's 
treasury policy, transactional exposure is primarily managed 
through natural hedges, which means that the risk of major 
performance impact due to fluctuations in exchange rates 
is reduced by having available cash with the corresponding 
currency distribution as for future payments of current 
liabilities. the applied principle also implies that the group 
will strive to make product purchases with the same currency 
distribution as budgeted revenues. in addition the group shall 
evaluate any imbalances in the currency inflow and outflow 
and seek forward contracts to hedge those imbalances. the 
group has in this respect during 2020 recognised a surplus 
of dkk, eur and nok and a deficit of sek. during the year, 
the group did not had any active secured hedge contracts. 
as shown in the table below, the group's main transaction 
exposure consists of sek, dkk, eur and nok. a 3% stronger 
sek against the eur and dkk would have a positive effect 
on profit for the year of sek 17.0 million. a 3% stronger nok 
against the sek would have a positive effect on profit before 
tax for the year of sek 12.4 million.

interest rate risk
the group is exposed to interest rate risk on interest-
bearing long-term and current liabilities. the group is 
exposed to the impact of variable interest on liabilities 
to credit institutions. on fixed-rate loans, the group is 
exposed to market risk. with regards to the group’s loan-
to-value ratio, the present interest risk is limited. during 
2020 the average effective interest rate to liabilities 
to credit institutions has been 1.6% per annum (1.5%). if 
interest rates had been 3 percentage points higher with all 
other variables held constant, profit before tax for the year 
would have been approximately sek 7.7 million lower. 
if the interest will increase with 3 % the group´s future lease 
contracts will be discounted with an implicit rate of 4.6 %.
credit risk
group principles state that customers who wish to trade 
on credit do so through a third-party solution through a 
financial institute in which the group takes no credit risk. 
other receivables consists mainly of undeposited funds 
from customer transactions in connection with reporting 
date where the group recognise a receivable towards 
162
boozt ab / annual report 2020
consolidated financial statements
a financial institute until the group receive the payment 
within a couple of days. to a small extent other legal entities  
are invoiced. 
the counter parties to the group's account receivables are 
the group´s brand partners which the group continuously 
buy goods from and the group has an accounts payable 
to. the account receivables are monitored continuously 
and the value of doubtful debts is not significant. see 
information in note 19. with regard to credit risks arising 
from the group's other financial assets, which include 
cash and cash equivalents, the group's main credit risk 
is associated with counterparties' failure to comply with 
their commitments, e.g. due to the counterparty going 
into bankruptcy. the group's maximum exposure consists 
of the carrying value of these financial instruments. 
approximately 96.5 % of the group's financial assets has 
a financial institute or bank as counter part. of the group's 
financial assets, including cash and cash equivalent, 
approximately 92.6 % are towards the group's main 
bank, danske bank. placement of liquid assets may only 
be made in banks or credit institutions with a high credit 
rating in accordance with the group's treasury policy. 
historically, there have never been any customer losses 
regarding cash and cash equivalents, and it is also not 
considered likely that this will occur in the future. the 
group assesses that there is no significant credit risk for 
the group's financial assets at the end of 2020.
liquidity risk
the liquidity risk to which the group is exposed is 
attributable to the operation’s seasonal variations. 
purchases are cyclical, and inventories are built up before 
each season, based on the group's expected sales. 
this means that the timing of the outflow of cash for the 
purchase of stock items is not consistent with the timing of 
inflows of cash and cash equivalents attributable to sales, 
resulting in a liquidity risk. the liquidity risk is managed by 
the principle of financial flexibility covered by the group's 
treasury policy and implies that there should be available 
liquid funds covering expected liquidity needs during the 
periods when the group has the lowest access to liquid 
funds. this is managed by having access to overdraft 
facilities, which as per year-end 2020 amounts to sek 60 
million and a revolving credit facility of another sek 200 
million, which can be called without further credit approval. 
as per year-end 2020, available liquidy amounts to sek 
1,974.5 million. there is also a liquidity risk attributable 
to business growth and the need to improve, upgrade 
and invest in technology and infrastructure to manage 
increased sales volumes and complexity in operations. to 
manage this risk, the board of directors has set guidelines 
for the level of liquidity reserves to strive for in order to 
meet the arising needs. 
cash flow forecasts are prepared and followed up on a 
weekly basis (operational activities, credits and current 
liquidity). rolling forecasts are also prepared to ensure 
constant availability of sufficient liquidity to meet business 
needs as well as to have reserves in unexploited credit 
flows. the group monitors that credit limits are not 
violated. further information on maturity analysis is 
provided on page 164. 
capital risk management
regarding capital structure, the group strives to secure 
the group’s ability to continue to operate in order to 
continue to generate profit for shareholders and value 
for other stakeholders as well as maintaining an optimal 
capital structure. to maintain or adjust the capital 
structure, the group can change any future dividends 
paid to shareholders, repay capital to shareholders, issue 
new shares or sell assets to reduce liabilities. the group 
assesses the capital based on the debt/equity ratio. the 
debt/equity ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total 
capital. net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including 
current interest bearing liabilities and non-current interest 
bearing liabilities) less cash and cash equivalents. the 
group has covenant obligations requiring that group’s net 
debt to adjusted ebitda ratio does not increase above 
3.0:1 and that the interest coverage ratio must not be less 
than 4.0:1. the covenants are reported quarterly on a 
rolling 12-month basis and has not been breached at any 
time during 2020. see note 22 for further information.

parent company accounting principles
the parent company has prepared its annual accounts in 
accordance with the swedish annual accounts act and 
the recommendation rfr2 ‘accounting for legal entities’ 
issued by the swedish financial reporting council.
the differences between the group's and the parent 
company's accounting principles are shown below. the 
below stated accounting principles of the parent company 
have been applied consistently to all periods presented in 
the parent company’s financial reports, unless otherwise 
stated.
subsidiaries
participations in subsidiaries are recognised in the parent 
company using the acquisition cost method. this means 
that transaction costs are included in the carrying value of 
participations in subsidiaries.
financial assets and liabilities
due to the connection between accounting and taxation, 
the rules on financial instruments in accordance with 
ifrs 9 are not applied in the parent company as a legal 
entity, but the parent company applies in accordance with 
the swedish annual accounts act, the acquisition cost 
method. in the parent company, thus financial fixed assets 
are valued at acquisition cost less any impairment loss 
and financial current assets at the lower of cost or market.
shareholders’ contributions
shareholders' contributions are recognised directly 
against equity at the recipient and capitalised in shares 
and participations at the contributor to the extent 
impairment is not required.
accounting of group contributions
paid and received group contributions are recognised as 
an appropriation.
estimates and assumptions
preparation of the financial reports in accordance with 
rfr 2 requires management to make assessments and 
estimates and assumptions that affect application of 
the accounting policies and the recognised amounts of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. actual results may 
differ from these estimates. estimates and assumptions 
are continually evaluated. changes in estimates are 
recognised in the period the change is made if the change 
only affected that period or in the period the change is 
made and in future periods if the change affects both 
current and future periods.
share based payments
for lti program 2019/2022 and lti program 2020/2023, a 
probability assessment of reaching the pre-defined targets 
and fulfil the terms and condition for achieving a grant of 
performance share is performed at each reporting date. 
the assessments are thereby a factor in the calculation of 
the liability (social charges) for share based payments to 
employees for the period.
more information can be found in note 9 for the group.

auditor's report
to the general meeting of the shareholders of boozt ab 
(publ) corporate identity number 556793-5183
this is a translation of the swedish language original. in 
the events of any differences between this translation and 
the swedish original, the latter shall prevail.
report on the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts
opinions
we have audited the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts of boozt ab (publ) for the financial year  
2020-01-01 - 2020-12-31. the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts of the company are included on 
pages 104-177 in this document.
in our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared 
in accordance with the annual accounts act and present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
the parent company as of 31 december 2020 and its 
financial performance and cash flow for the year then 
ended in accordance with the annual accounts act. the 
consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance 
with the annual accounts act and present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of the group as 
of 31 december 2020 and their financial performance 
and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance 
with international financial reporting standards (ifrs), 
as adopted by the eu, and the annual accounts act. our 
opinion does not include the sustainablity report on pages 
36-75 and corporate goverance report on pages 77-101. 
the statutory administration report is consistent with 
the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts.
we therefore recommend that the general meeting of 
shareholders adopts the income statement and balance 
sheet for the parent company and the group. 
our opinions in this report on the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts are consistent with the content 
of the additional report that has been submitted to the 
parent company's audit committee in accordance with  
the audit regulation (537/2014) article 11.
basis for opinions
we conducted our audit in accordance with international 
standards on auditing (isa) and generally accepted 
auditing standards in sweden. our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the auditor’s 
responsibilities section. we are independent of the parent 
company and the group in accordance with professional 
ethics for accountants in sweden and have otherwise 
fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements. this includes that, based on the 
best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services 
referred to in the audit regulation (537/2014) article 5.1 
have been provided to the audited company or, where 
applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies 
within the eu. 
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinions.
key audit matters
key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
of the current period. these matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.

revenue recognition with right of return 
inventory valuation
description of risk
the group recognizes revenue when the control has been 
transferred to the buyer and its amount can be measured in a 
reliable manner and it is probable that future economic benefits 
will accrue to the group. net sales amount to sek 4,359 million 
in 2020, spread over approximately 5.5 million customer orders, 
which means that boozt handles large transaction volumes on a 
daily basis. well-established routines for secure it operations and 
well-functioning it processes are thus of great importance for 
boozt's operations since the extensive and intensive transaction 
volume means that completeness is critical for a significant error 
in the financial reporting not to arise. revenue recognition also 
includes estimates and judgments since the reserve for expected 
returns, which as of december 31, 2020 amounts to sek 177 million, 
is based on historical data and management's judgement.
consequently, revenue recognition of sales of goods with the right 
of return is deemed to be a key audit matter.
for further information, see note 1 on “accounting principles” 
revenue and estimates and assumptions, note 3 “net sales per 
region and distribution of income”, and note 24 ”accrued expenses 
and prepaid income ”. 
our audit procedures
our audit procedures included, but were not limited to:
•  review of general security controls for involved systems for 
customer orders, inventories and accounting systems with 
involvement of it auditor.
•  data analysis on completeness and accuracy in sales and 
inventory transactions.
•  review of the group's processes and routines for revenue 
recognition with tests of design and implementation of key 
controls.
•  assessed the management's assumption by comparing the 
accuracy of historical assessments in order to assess the 
precision and made the subsequent examination of actual 
outcomes of returns.
•  review of completeness and correctness in relevant notes and 
disclosures provided in the financial statements.
description of risk
on december 31, 2020, boozt´s inventories representing 
approximately 31% of the group's total assets and amounts to sek 
1,247 million. inventories mainly consist of goods in the group's 
central warehouse in Ängelholm. inventories are valued at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value, where the acquisition value 
is calculated according to the "first-in-first-out principle" and the 
net realisable value is defined as the selling price reduced by 
selling costs.
incorrect assessment of purchases and large stocks that bind 
capital entail a risk of obsolescence and to determine the size of 
the obsolescence, the management must make assessments of 
future events and sales of individual products and product groups.
the size of the post and the inherent complexity of assessment 
and estimation are critical and increases the risk of material 
misstatement in the financial reporting, which is why valuation of 
inventories is considered a key audit matter.
for further information, see note 1 on “accounting principles” 
on inventories and estimates and assumptions, and note 18 
“inventories”.
our audit procedures
our audit procedures included, but were not limited to:
•  review of the group's processes and routines regarding the 
reporting of inventories with tests of design and implementation 
of key controls
•  carried out data analysis to identify slow-moving and obsolete 
items and possibly additional obsolescence needs.
•  participated at a physical inventory count.
•  performed data analysis on sales transactions to ensure that 
valuation takes place according to the lowest value principle.
•  review of completeness and correctness in relevant notes and 
disclosures provided in the financial statements.

accounts does not cover this other information and we do

this other information.
in connection with our audit of the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the 
information identified above and consider whether the 
information is materially inconsistent with the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts. in this procedure we 
also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained 
in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.
if we, based on the work performed concerning this 
information, conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that 
fact. we have nothing to report in this regard.
responsibilities of the board of directors and  
the managing director
the board of directors and the managing director are 
responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts 
and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair 
presentation in accordance with the annual accounts act 
and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance 
with ifrs as adopted by the eu. the board of directors 
and the managing director are also responsible for such 
internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts, the board of directors and the managing director 
are responsible for the assessment of the company’s and 
the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. they 
disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting. the 
going concern basis of accounting is however not applied 
if the board of directors and the managing director intends 
to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so. 
the audit committee shall, without prejudice to the board 
of director’s responsibilities and tasks in general, among 
other things oversee the company’s financial reporting 
process.
auditor’s responsibility
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinions. reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with isas and generally accepted 
auditing standards in sweden will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts.
a further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the annual accounts and consolidated accounts is located 
at the swedish inspectorate of auditors website:  
www.revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar.  
this description forms part of the auditor´s report. 
from the matters communicated with the board of 
directors, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts, including the most important 
assessed risks for material misstatement, and are 
therefore the key audit matters. we describe these 
matters in the auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes disclosure about the matter.
report on other legal and regulatory requirements
opinions
in addition to our audit of the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts, we have also audited the 
administration of the board of directors and the managing 
director of boozt ab (publ) for the financial year 2020-01-
01 - 2020-12-31 and the proposed appropriations of the 
company’s profit or loss.

consolidated financial statements
we recommend to the general meeting of shareholders 
that the profit to be appropriated in accordance with the 
proposal in the statutory administration report and that 
the members of the board of directors and the managing 
director be discharged from liability for the financial year. 
basis for opinions
we conducted the audit in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards in sweden. our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s 
responsibilities section. we are independent of the parent 
company and the group in accordance with professional 
ethics for accountants in sweden and have otherwise 
fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinions.
responsibilities of the board of directors and  
the managing director
the board of directors is responsible for the proposal 
for appropriations of the company’s profit or loss. at 
the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment 
of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the 
requirements which the company's and the group’s type 
of operations, size and risks place on the size of the 
parent company's and the group’s equity, consolidation 
requirements, liquidity and position in general.
the board of directors is responsible for the company’s 
organization and the administration of the company’s 
affairs. this includes among other things continuous 
assessment of the company’s and the group’s financial 
situation and ensuring that the company's organization 
is designed so that the accounting, management of 
assets and the company’s financial affairs otherwise are 
controlled in a reassuring manner. the managing director 
shall manage the ongoing administration according to the 
board of directors’ guidelines and instructions and among 
other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfill 
the company’s accounting in accordance with law and 
handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner.
auditor’s responsibility
our objective concerning the audit of the administration, 
and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, 
is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable 
degree of assurance whether any member of the board of 
directors or the managing director in any material respect:
• has undertaken any action or been guilty of any 
omission which can give rise to liability to the company, 
or
• in any other way has acted in contravention of the 
companies act, the annual accounts act or the 
articles of association.
our objective concerning the audit of the proposed 
appropriations of the company’s profit or loss, and thereby 
our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree 
of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with 
the companies act.
reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with generally accepted auditing standards in sweden 
will always detect actions or omissions that can give 
rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed 
appropriations of the company’s profit or loss are not in 
accordance with the companies act. 
a further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the annual accounts and consolidated accounts is located 
at the swedish inspectorate of auditors website:

gross sales (incl. shipping and invoice income) less 
discounts and returns, excl. vat.
"the aim of the figure is to display the total consumer value of the 
orders processed less returns and excluding vat. transactional net 
revenue less fee to consignment partners plus other revenue not 
related to consumer orders equals net revenue. the transactional net 
revenue can be calculated as average order value (aov) multiplied 
with no. of orders."
true frequency
apm
order frequency for customers that have been with boozt.com 
during last 12 months, hence not impacted by orders from new 
customers.
this figure isolates the co-hort which purchased with the group 12 
months ago, and then looks at this co-hort's behaviour for the pro-
ceeding 12 months in terms of frequency (how many orders do they 
place on average). this will give the reader an understanding about 
the co-horts frequency behaviour once they mature.
