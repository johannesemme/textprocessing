increased focus on sustainable and 
profitable growth 
2020 was probably the most abnormal year for many 
decades – at least for royal unibrew. however, our 
strategy proved its strength and our local management 
model demonstrated once again agility, customer 
closeness and great service levels despite significant 
changes on a daily basis. while working intensively 
on the short-term hour by hour, we managed to keep 
focus on the long-term growth opportunities within 
e.g. low/no-alcohol, low/no-sugar and in categories 
within energy drinks and ready-to-drink and thereby 
enhanced our position in these categories. 
the beginning of 2020 was at full steam, january and febru-
ary were strong and our pipeline of launches and innovations 
was very promising in all channels. when covid-19 broke 
out in italy at the beginning of march and soon thereafter 
in northern europe, sales in on-trade and convenience in 
particular halted and off-trade did not really catch up as con-
sumers destocked home inventories. april and may were very 
uncertain months but as societies partly re-opened towards 
summer, we experienced improved sales despite restrictions 
in events and gatherings in general. the uplift in sales was led 
by a combination of good weather and staycation effects. in 
total, september and october turned out to be close to nor-
mal months, while november and december on the contrary 
were quite difficult months. just to illustrate the volatility we 
have experienced.
despite all of the above:
•  we managed to get through the year with very few  
covid-19 infected employees
•  our ranking by our customers was strength-
ened even further 
•  we increased our value market share in 
all our key markets by channel
•  we managed to improve our financial 
performance
•  our produced and supplied volume 
is the highest ever by the company 
we could not have done this with-
out an outstanding performance 
and strong teamwork in the entire 
organization. we managed to in-
crease communication instant-
ly and digitally to secure that 
everybody was well informed, 
and we shared learnings 
across countries and within 
countries across channels. 
some employees moved from 
on-trade to off-trade or from 
on-trade to logistics with few 
days’ notice; others were sent 
home on different schemes 
or simply taking holidays while

some unfortunately had to leave the company on a more 
permanent basis. i would like to thank all employees for a 
solid performance, something we can all be proud of.
in the convenience, on-trade, sports and event channels the 
pandemic has had huge consequences, and many custom-
ers have had to rethink their business model and e.g. move 
into take-away instead of restaurant dining. i hope that our 
customers have felt that we - with innovation and local un-
derstanding - have been there for them throughout 2020. we 
are ready and eager to assist them in re-establishing solid 
business when the societies re-open to a new normal. 
from an investor perspective our share price has been on 
a rollercoaster during the year as we were one of the first 
companies in the beverage industry to withdraw guidance. 
we were also one of the first ones to resume with a guidance, 
which in our mind was the right thing to do from a legal 
perspective, but certainly also from a business perspective. 
most importantly for us, has been to secure our strong flight 
altitude into 2021 and towards a more permanent opening of 
the societies in which we do business. this also means that 
commercially we have spent sufficiently in 2020 in order not 
to lose ground versus competition and to increase likelihood 
for future growth. as we got full transparency on the cash 
generation during the summer, we resumed the share buy-
back and paid out the full dividend.
since i took the helm as ceo on 1 september 2020, we have 
reorganized the leadership of the company by establishing a 
senior leadership team with six leaders including hr with 
a core focus on commercial closeness, continuity and diver-
sity. we aim to build our organization even stronger and with 
a bench that continuously evolves and will supplement the 
existing team in our aspiration to grow organically as well as 
through acquisitions. 
together, we have re-visited and aligned on our short-term 
as well as on our longer-term strategy. on our strategic route 
we are continuously creating evolution rather than revolution 
and, in that context, we have taken a longer view on cate-
gories, countries and channels during recent months and 
established our long-term view on consumer trends. our 
conclusion is a combination of reconfirming and redefining 
our focus slightly. we reconfirm areas within low/no-alcohol, 
low/no-sugar & premium products, while we increase our 
ambitions and growth views in e.g. the energy drinks, en-
hanced drinks and ready-to-drink categories.
finally, as specified in the full year statement from 2019 we 
have established a long-term ambition for the total csr area 
which aims to move us in the front among sustainable bev-
erage companies within the next five years. we are generally 
already performing well but have identified mid-term oppor-
tunities that will enhance the outcome quite significantly. not 
all is yet known and technologies will evolve so we will stay 
open-minded through our journey. an important factor - and 
in particular in terms of the co₂ emission - is the support 
we get from our suppliers but also from local municipalities 
in the areas where we produce. generally, we see csr as an 
integrated part of our strategy which enhances our business 
opportunities.
thanks to all around us for continued support.

who we are
2020 started with ambitious plans and focus on 
continuing the underlying positive development in 
earnings. after a strong beginning in january and 
february all plans were changed in march when the 
covid-19 pandemic became a reality. 
to manage the high uncertainty, we revised our plans based 
on the following principles:
• protect our employees
• support customers
• prepare for the worst case and manage cost
• protect our liquidity position
initially, in late march and april it was difficult to foresee 
how the market environment would react. however, since 
june our business has performed strongly until november 
when our main markets were impacted by the second wave 
of the pandemic.
our revised new plan for the year has worked and we have 
managed to deliver a profitability slightly above 2019 and with 
growing market shares.
strong performance in 2020
the assumptions for our plans for 2020 were no longer rele-
vant after the lockdown in march. compared to any other year, 
categories and sales channels have developed very differently 
during the year. the commercial parts of our organization 
have done an outstanding job in refocusing sales efforts to 
the growing categories and sales channels and at the same 
cfo letter
tight focus and planning led to 
strong performance 
time spending a minimum of resources on declining are-
as. we have never experienced such extensive changes in 
volumes from on-trade to off-trade and from kegs to cans 
and pet. our supply chain colleagues have shown great 
ability to adapt to the new reality and produced record 
volumes during the summer.
a key learning in situations when assumptions change 
dramatically is to drop the budget and make a new plan 
with maximum flexibility. as we worked with limited 
visibility, we had clear guiding principles for decision 
making. across the business we made many new short-
term plans and shifted resources to segments with 
positive momentum. our business model with strong 
country organizations and clear local decision power 
has shown very effective also in situations with high 
uncertainty.

a good momentum, but the 
start of the year seems to be 
challenging”

balancing short and long term
the spending level we had during the summer months was 
not consistent with our ambitions to continue to grow and 
develop the business. consequently, we started initiatives 
during the late summer to ensure that we have momentum 
as we move into 2021. this includes capacity expansion pro-
jects, selective commercial initiatives, it investments and 
maintenance cost.
liquidity and capital allocation
as uncertainty was high in the spring, we made additional 
credit facilities, postponed dividend payment and the initiated 
share buy-back program. the guiding principle has been to 
maximize our financial flexibility in order to be ready for both 
difficult markets but also for potential m&a projects. 
over the summer, we saw the markets develop positively and 
cash flow generation was strong. therefore, we decided to 
pay out dividend and initiate two tranches of share buy-back 
programs. 
in order to secure that our roic develops positively over time, 
we target to manage the investments by keeping investments 
around 5% of revenue (excl. m&a). this will be a challeng-
ing target to meet as our ambitions within sustainability will 
require investments as well as the continued growth will 
demand more investments in capacity.
back to growth
our ambition is to return to profitable topline growth again in 
2021. across the business we have interesting organic growth 
opportunities that we aim to focus on. the planning for 2021 
is a bit unusual as we still live with covid-19 related restric-
tions and it is likely that the start of the year will be difficult. 
consequently, we have commercial initiatives that will not be 
committed before we have more clarity on how restrictions 
and the vaccine will impact the trading conditions.
we expect 2021 to end with a good momentum, but the start 
of the year may be challenging.

royal unibrew’s overall strategy remains to be a 
strong regional multi-beverage provider in select-
ed core markets and in other markets to build and 
develop strong niche positions. 
royal unibrew operates in diverse markets that are char-
acterized by different dynamics. we aim to be the preferred 
choice for our consumers, customers, shareholders and peo-
ple through the following four strategic priorities.
we want to expand our markets and market shares through multi-beverage and niche strategies. 
we need to continuously develop and innovate our product portfolio and channel mix to be the preferred choice for 
consumers. we will also continue to pursue opportunities to continuously enhance the efficiency across the company.
we want to be the preferred partner for our customers with the most relevant innovations for our consumers by 
addressing consumer demographies, geographies and trends of e.g. health and wellness, authenticity and care for 
the environment.
we will pursue structural improvements through m&a and partnerships with focus on western europe. 
we will maintain royal unibrew’s financial flexibiliy by continuously considering our capital structure with the intention 
of adjusting it to support the realization of the strategic and financial targets.
we will convert our energy consumption to renewable energy and also focus on the entire value chain and include 
the consumption by our suppliers. we will work with suppliers that share our values and focus on green energy 
consumption and lower the impact from packaging material through recycling.
as a regionally based beverage company founded on strong local presence in the societies of typically rural areas, 
royal unibrew aims to be a responsible member of the community.
we will invest in renewable energy and have an open mindset towards new technologies. operational efficiencies 
and circular thinking have always been a part of the royal unibrew dna.
becoming the most sustainable beverage company requires that all employees are engaged in the journey and we 
will work persistently to embed a sustainability mindset throughout our organization.

insights and strong competences are required to reach our ambitious strategic targets. therefore, we strive to create a 
culture that encourages talent, develops skills and competences, recognizes achievements and values each individual. 
we give high priority to retaining experienced employees and recruiting new employees who bring accelerated 
momentum and new knowledge. this includes a diverse and strong blend of educational background, work and life 
experience, diversity of beliefs, nationality and gender.
a succession process ensures identification of talents and ensures acceleration of careers within royal unibrew.

we have a strong performance culture with a very 
solid operating model that fits well with our portfolio 
of strong local brands. 
royal unibrew has built its business on the core belief that 
beverages and the nature of the business make it important 
to be close to customers and act locally. this is reflected in 
the composition of our business and brands. 
our business is built on one common group it platform, per-
formance management system and procurement setup. this 
gives us the ability to obtain transparency and to optimize our 
business processes across the group. 
all other functions are managed locally under the supervision 
of the country manager. we operate with marketing depart-
ments and sales organizations having competences to make 
commercial decisions in each individual country/market. this 
ensures proximity to our consumers and customers in the 
different markets and product portfolios which are managed 
locally. profitability and competition by category differ from 
country to country and consequently our model enables our 
local organization to prioritize where to invest and focus.
royal unibrew operates with a flat organizational structure 
with few management layers. e.g., all country managers re-
port directly to the senior leadership team. the corporate 
functions are designed according to the business model and 
consequently group functions are kept at a minimum level. 
this ensures that activities in the single countries are not 
duplicated centrally.
digital approach 
our digital journey is a key enabler of our future success. for 
the main processes we strive to work on common systems 
once the processes have reached a certain maturity level. e.g., 
we operate with one groupwide erp system based on sap 
and several related tools that are common across the group.
in areas where development varies across countries, we allow 
local solutions to be developed; particularly in the commercial 
area. however, as the processes mature we strive to roll out 
common solutions across the group.

our growth formula
we continue to pursue and remains committed 
to deliver profitable growth and thereby a strong 
cash-flow generation. to maintain momentum in our 
business we work within a number of areas: 
we aspire to be consumers’ and customers’ preferred bev-
erage provider through investments in our existing portfolio, 
but also from developing new products and thereby over time 
providing a more sustainable beverage offering.
we strive to create a culture that attracts and maintains 
talents, develops skills and competences, as well as offers 
personal development opportunities for our employees.
we aim to create a positive total shareholders return, through 
a combination of growing distribution (dividends and share 
buy-backs) over time as well as an increasing share price.
our target is to grow faster than the market in which we 
compete and consequently increase our value market share.
the ambition is to reduce the ratio of fixed costs per net 
revenue every year.
we also strive to create value by acquiring companies. the 
foundation for acquisitions is always that it can be incorporat-
ed in our operating model and our business model enables 
us to extract synergies.
to fuel growth in medium to long-term, we strive to increase commercial 
spending directed towards growth initiatives every year. the increase will 
depend on the opportunities identified in the marketplace.
•  we want to be the preferred partner 
to our customers. this is achieved 
by strong focus on in-store execution 
and ensuring that our products are 
displayed well in customers’ prem-
ises to ensure that customers per-
form well in the individual beverage 
categories.
•  we want to grow distribution by fo-
cusing on channels where our prod-
ucts are underrepresented.
•  we want to prioritize commercial 
spending to support growing cate-
gories and channels.
efficiency 
improvements
• efficiency remains a key pillar in our 
value creation journey. the key driver 
of efficiency is operating leverage. 
we achieve operating leverage by 
growing the topline faster than our 
fixed cost. our multi beverage oper-
ating model enables us to achieve 
higher utilization of fixed assets, sell 
more per salesperson, have higher 
average drop size to customers and 
in general have higher productivity 
per employee.
• the foundation for continued im-
provement of our productivity is that 
we are able to digitalize and stand-
ardize as many processes as possi-
ble. in terms of servicing our custom-
ers there is a constant battle between 
offering a good and personalized 
service level and at the same time 
manage costs. our guiding principle 
is to spend as little time as possible 
on repetitive tasks in order to direct 
time towards value creating tasks. 
premiumization
•  we want to continuously develop 
new products at a more premium 
level than the average portfolio we 
currently offer. this enables royal 
unibrew to obtain a higher price and 
to deliver better value to consumers 
and customers. 
•  we want to grow the more profitable 
channels faster and thereby offer a 
product portfolio with better value.
•  we want to direct our commercial 
spending to the more premium part 
of our portfolio.

royal unibrew has two fundamental strategic routes 
which is multi beverage and niche position. the 
multi-beverage strategy is relevant in markets with 
a wide coverage of beverage categories and full 
channel coverage. the portfolio would aim to cover 
mainstream and above mainstream. 
the multi-beverage strategy is currently being pursued in 
denmark, finland, lithuania, latvia and estonia. 
from a value perspective the largest beverage categories 
in the markets are often beer, carbonated soft drink, energy 
drinks and rtd. our brand portfolios in the multi beverage 
markets are combinations of own locally anchored brands 
and partner brands from e.g. pepsico, heineken and dia-
geo. in the multi beverage market the combined value of the 
full portfolio is very important as it delivers leverage for our 
customers and for royal unibrew. economies of scale on all 
dimensions is a winning formula. 
the niche strategy is more targeted to either single brands 
or a few brands in the specific market. this strategy is  
currently being pursued in markets like e.g. italy, france,  
germany, austria, switzerland, us and canada. currently, most  
markets outside of the multi beverage territory would be  
either single brand or two brands markets, while markets like 
italy, us, uk, germany, canada and france are multi-niche 
markets. in most cases we would leverage an individual 
sales organization covering several channels in multi-niche  
markets, while niche markets would be serviced by local 
partners through our international key account organization.

non-alcoholic categories
our non-alcoholic beverage portfolio is outgrowing 
our alcoholic beverage portfolio, and we are repre-
sented in some very interesting growth categories. 
carbonated soft drinks (csd) constitutes 67% of our non-al-
coholic revenue. we have very strong positions in denmark 
and finland where faxe kondi and jaffa have market leading 
positions, respectively. in italy, lemon soda is #1 in the lemon 
category in the off-trade. on top of these local super brands, 
we have an international partnership with pepsico covering 
denmark, finland and the baltic countries.
around 12% of our non-alcoholic revenue stems from water. 
in finland, novelle is the market leader and operates within 
still, sparkling, and enhanced water. our co₂ neutral brand 
egekilde, which is sold in pet bottles made of 100% recycled 
plastic holds a market leading position in denmark. 2020 
was negatively impacted by convenience and on-trade sales. 
energy has grown to become a relatively large part of our 
non-alcoholic portfolio with 8% of revenue in 2020. energy is 
growing faster than the average beverage market in all our 
markets, and our brands cult, faxe kondi booster and ed is 
very well received by consumers and customers.
our malt beverage business is 7% of our non-alcoholic rev-
enue. our brands, vitamalt, supermalt and power malt are 
primarily sold in the americas and africa as well as among 
ethnic groups from these areas living in and around major 
cities in europe and the us.
the share of non-alcoholic beers has increased to more than 
2% of our non-alcoholic beverage revenue, as it grew almost 
19% from 2019 to 2020. we have a strong portfolio of alcohol- 
free beers based on our local strong brand portfolio, as well 
as heineken 0.0 through our international partnership cov-
ering denmark and finland.
other non-alcoholic beverages constitute 4% of our non- 
alcoholic revenue of which the majority is juice where our 
cido brand has a very strong market position in the baltic 
countries.

in 2020, the alcoholic beverage segment was severe-
ly impacted by covid-19 in all our markets, espe-
cially in the on-trade segment.
beer is by far the largest revenue contributor to our alcoholic 
beverage segment, as it contributes around 71% of revenue. 
we have strong market positions in denmark, finland and 
the baltic countries and is the market leader in the super 
premium segment in italy. we also produce, sell and distrib-
ute heineken in denmark and finland. our export brand faxe 
is growing significantly in the international segment and is 
heading toward 1 mhl in 2021.
around 21% of our alcoholic beverage revenue stems from ci-
der and rtd where we have strong positions in denmark and 
finland. in denmark, shaker has a strong position, whereas 
original long drink in finland is the market leader in the 
segment.
in finland, we offer a range of international spirits and wine 
brands, including johnny walker, captain morgan, lanson, 
jp chenet and baileys on an agency basis, and constitutes 
around 8% of revenue in the alcoholic beverages segment.

financial targets, capital structure and distribution policy
our financial targets are based both on creating 
shareholder value and developing the business for 
the benefit of all stakeholders. to achieve this, we 
aim to create financial flexibility to develop the busi-
ness over the medium to long term. 
the capability of achieving the financial targets is conditional 
on continuous business development through focus on growth 
opportunities, partnerships, innovation, sales and marketing, 
and on continuous efficiency measures. the positive devel-
opment in recent years has enabled us to increase our ebit 
margin target and to make considerable distributions to our 
shareholders. 
ebit margin
our medium-term ebit margin target is 19-20%.
in 2020, we achieved an ebit margin of 20%. the year was very 
unusual as the margin over the year varied significantly from a 
normal year due to covid-19 and cost level was unusually low. 
the ebit margin is best in class when compared to other bev-
erage companies in europe and has increased substantially 
over recent years due to strong strategic and commercial 
execution and cost management. the profit growth formu-
la has worked well in recent years and will be continued in 
alignment with the same principles. 
our focus is to stay within the ebit margin target and focus 
on growing the absolute ebit by securing funds to invest in 
supporting the organic growth opportunities that arise in 
our markets.  
capital structure and distribution policy
the objective of our capital structure policy is to secure 
enough flexibility to develop the business in line with our stra-
tegic priorities. it remains the target that net interest-bearing 
debt is not to exceed 2.5 times ebitda and that an equity 
ratio of at least 30% is to be maintained at year-end. given 
the current composition of the balance sheet, the equity ratio 
is the ratio that determines the pay-out capabilities. we may 
depart from the targeted ratios for a certain period of time if 
structural business opportunities arise. 
our priorities for capital allocation are as follows:
1.  maintain financial flexibility 
• net debt/ebitda less than 2.5 
• equity ratio of more than 30%
2. invest in organic growth
3. acquisitions
4. stable dividend pay-out ratio (40-60%)
5. share buy-backs to adjust capital structure
our annual investments including repayment on lease facil-
ities (ifrs 16) are expected to be around 5% of net revenue. 
management evaluates on an ongoing basis if the capital 
structure is to be adjusted by launching share buy-back pro-
grams. it is generally the intention that shares bought back 
will be cancelled.

the start to 2021 has taken place in the shadow 
of covid-19. our on-trade business has been hit 
through tough restrictions imposed on restaurants, 
bars, night entertainment, sports and music events 
and much more. 
the off-trade business is not picking up as much of the lost 
sale in on-trade during the winter months, as the case was 
in the spring of 2020. this is because there are not the same 
outdoor drinking occasions during the winter and because 
gathering restrictions are much tighter now compared to the 
first round of lock-downs. as a result, uncertainty continues at 
elevated levels, and this year’s results are strongly dependa-
ble on when restrictions on the on-trade business are lifted, 
and on when gathering restrictions are eased. 
the current environment therefore caters for a continued 
focus on cost flexibility, production planning, the capability 
to deliver, while at the same time pursue our commercial 
agenda and continuously find the pockets of growth in our 
markets and still be ready for the reopening of societies on 
the back of the pandemic. despite the current circumstances, 
we expect to deliver an ebit in the range of dkk 1,475-1,625 
million, which should be compared to ebit of dkk 1,515 mil-
lion in 2020. compared to 2019 where we realized an ebit of 
dkk 1,469 million, we therefore expect to grow our ebit by 
up to 11%, despite the negative impacts caused by covid-19.
the board of directors has decided to initiate a share buy-
back program of up to dkk 250 million as soon as possible 
covering the period until 30 june 2021. during the summer, 
it will be decided whether an additional share buy-back will 
be initiated based on the state of covid-19 and our financial 
flexibility at that point.the board of directors will recommend 
to the agm in 2021 a distribution of ordinary dividend of dkk 
13.50 per share. hence, at least dkk 915 million is expected 
to be distributed based on the financial statements for 2020. 
assumptions about markets and main priorities for 2021 
we want to continue to grow faster than the market in all the 
markets we compete, by overinvesting in pockets of growth 
across our footprint. we expect to move towards normali-
zation as restrictions are eased, normalizing our sales and 
marketing expenses, building our brand equity further and 
investing in the opportunities that will arise once societies 
reopen. our organization is prepared for different scenarios 
given the volatile environment we are in, which means that 
we have a tight focus on our cost base, while we at the same 
time invest cautiously behind our mainstream brands. given 
our new sustainability strategy we are investing in csr to 
strengthen our medium-term opportunities, as well as we 
are investing in capacity expansions.
our strategic focus remains set on products with low and 
no sugar and alcohol and premium and craft products. on 
top of this, we want to take advantage of the high growth in 
energy drinks and rtd/cocktails, as well as the continuing 
trend towards healthier beverages, which are benefiting our 
enhanced waters. 
that said, 2021 will be a year with continued high uncertainty 
why flexibility in planning and use of cost is very important. 
the key risks to our business outlook are when restrictions 
will be lifted and gathering restrictions eased, especially in 
denmark, italy and finland, but also if consumers after this 
will return towards the consumption behavior they had in 2019.
the high end of our ebit guidance range assumes that 
on-trade restrictions are lifted and gathering restrictions 
eased around 1 april 2021, and that the on-trade therefore 
is opened through the entire summer. at the low end of our 
ebit guidance range, we have assumed that restrictions are 
lifted around 1 july 2021.
the low end of our ebit guidance range includes lower sales 
and marketing costs, compared to the high end of the guid-
ance range. in that scenario, the development in gathering 
restrictions will be an important factor, because when these 
are eased, people are able to meet again inside, but also 
outside in the spring and early summer months. we are as-
suming a normal summer in 2021 and christmas season.
our free cash flow in 2020 was positively affected by several 
factors, of which around dkk 200 million are expected to 
revert during 2021. in 2020, mix shifted towards off-trade and 
northern europe where businesses in general have shorter 
payment terms. we expect business activity to normalize 
during 2021. we also do not expect to continue the extraordi-
nary beer campaign activity in finland, which will impact our 
cash flow negatively compared to 2020. on top of this comes 
payment of delayed tax payments and for holiday accruals in 
denmark (legislation change). in total, these factors are ex-
pected to generate a net working capital headwind of around 
dkk 200 million in 2021 compared to 2020.

busi – outlook for 2021
financial assumptions
•  as 2020 was a normal summer, the 2021 outlook has 
been made under same assumption.
•  net selling prices are assumed to be slightly increasing 
during 2021 as a result of the reopening of the on-trade 
business as well as growth in the convenience (single 
serve) channel. in addition, our overall premiumization 
efforts and price/pack strategies in each segment and 
country will support a positive price/mix development. 
these efforts are unchanged and include optimization of 
the product mix.
•  generally, costs are expected to follow the inflation in 
2021. commercial costs are expected to increase in 
connection with growth initiatives and investments in 
the existing business, as well as a pick-up in sales and 
marketing costs compared to 2020 following the expect-
ed reopening.
•  we will continue our focus on generating continuous 
improvements and enhancing efficiency across the 
business and in all entities.
•  royal unibrew has entered into hedging agreements for 
a large part of the expected consumption of key raw and 
packaging materials for 2021.
•  exchange rates between dkk and other currencies are 
expected to remain unchanged as compared to the end 
of february 2021.
•  covid-19 has had a significant impact on the on-trade 
business in the first months of 2021, which is expected 
to continue until restrictions are lifted. the guidance is 
based on an opening during q2.
•  in 2021, our net investments are expected to be higher 
than set by our financial targets of around 5%, due to 
the fact that some capex-plans from 2020 were pushed 
into 2021, we will increase our investments in csr and 
expand capacity to support future growth.
•  corporate income tax rate is expected to amount to 
around 21% of profit before tax excluding income after 
tax from investments in associates.

financial review
2020 was a challenging year due to covid-19, but 
through tight planning and strong cost focus, royal 
unibrew came out of 2020 with increased market 
shares and a strong earnings performance.
initially 2020, started with ambitious plans to continue the 
underlying positive development in earnings, despite tough 
comparable from a very strong 2019. already in march, the 
covid-19 pandemic forced us to revise our plans, as restric-
tions were imposed on the on-trade channel in many of our 
markets. through tight planning and with a strong focus on 
costs, we managed to deliver a profitability slightly above 
last year, as well as expanding our market shares across 
most markets.
volumes
the volumes sold increased by 1% to 11.1 mhl and were or-
ganically at the same level as last year. 
net revenue
net revenue amounted to dkk 7,557 million and decreased 
3% organically. the reported net revenue decrease by 2% as 
the acquisitions contributed positively with 1%.
net revenue was negatively impacted by covid-19 in the 
western europe and baltic sea segment, whereas the inter-
national segment was able to grow 6% organically. 
ebit
ebit amounted to dkk 1,515 million, an increase of 3% com-
pared to 2019. ebit increased in the baltic sea and interna-
tional segments, whereas western europe declined mainly 
related to the result in the italian on-trade channel.
acquisitions impacted ebit by less than 1% at group level. 
in all our market the on-trade business was affected by 
covid-19 restrictions, which was only partly recovered by 
increased sales in the off-trade business. lower sales, mar-
keting and fixed costs contributed positively to the improved 
ebit result.

balance sheet
total assets at 31 december 2020 amounted to dkk 8,306 
million, which is dkk 187 million below the 31 december 
2019 figure, which is mainly explained by lower receivables 
and because amortization and depreciation of non-current 
assets exceeds investments in 2020.
equity amounted to dkk 3.332 million and the equity ratio 
improved by 3 percentages points to 40% by the end of 2020. 
 read more: page 82
cash flow
the free cash flow amounted to dkk 1,414 million in 2020 ver-
sus dkk 1,140 million in 2019. the increase of dkk 274 million 
was positively impacted by the extraordinary beer campaign 
in finland, extended payment term on employee tax, as well 
as channel and country mix.
the positive impact on cash flow from the extraordinary beer 
campaign in finland is due to longer payment terms on the 
excise payment compared to the customer payment and is a 
phasing impact between 2020 and 2021. in 2020, mix shifted 
towards off-trade and northern europe – both with shorter 
payment terms than group average – this is expected to nor-
malize in 2021. during 2020, different support programs and 
aid packages has been presented across countries. royal 
unibrew has only to a limited extend benefitted from these 
programs and packages. at the end of 2020, danish employee 
taxes to a total of dkk 45 million were postponed into 2021.
we estimate that the normalized free cash flow level for royal 
unibrew in 2020 was around dkk 1,150 million. in 2021, free 
cash flow will be negatively impacted as some of the positive 
impacts from 2020 will flow back, see outlook section. 
 read more: page 84
financing
net interest bearing debt was dkk 2,193 million at the end 
of 2020, corresponding to a net decrease of dkk 512 million 
equal to the positive free cash flow less distribution to share-
holders. at the end of 2020, the net interest-bearing debt to 
ebitda ratio was 1.2x (2019: 1.5x). our revolving credit facility 
has been extended for 1 year with final maturity end of 2023.
share buy-back
during the year, royal unibrew has repurchased shares at 
a total purchase price of dkk 362 million. (2019: dkk 433 
million). total announced programs were dk 400 million. 
the remainder of the programs have been completed in the 
beginning of 2021.

covid-19 restrictions. 
earnings before interest and tax (ebit) for 2020 showed a 
dkk 35 million decrease from dkk 722 million in 2019 to dkk 
687 million in 2020, due to the lower net revenue. the ebit

“the on-trade business was highly 
impacted by the covid-19 restrictions. 
however, due to the close cooperation

in q4 2020, volumes declined by 4% compared to q4 2019, 
whereas net revenue declined by 7% in the same period. both 
due to the covid-19 restrictions imposed on the on-trade 
channel throughout the region.

development and initiatives in 2020
during 2020, covid-19 restrictions on social gatherings and 
opening hours challenged the on-trade business in all mar-
kets. it also opened new opportunities that the organization 
quickly responded to.
after the covid-19 outbreak in denmark, a number of re-
strictions were introduced in march, including a closure of the 
borders to germany. the restrictions had a positive impact on 
the off-trade business in denmark and germany, although 
not in a scale that could compensate for the lost business in 
the on-trade channel and border business. 
the sales and supply teams responded quickly to support the 
growing off-trade business, while at the same time support-
ing on-trade customers in the difficult situation. during the 
lockdown, for example, we hosted the biggest virtual beer 
testing event in denmark and brewed a beer to the famous 
danish tv show “natholdet”, and when the market re-opened 
during the summer period, we supported bars and restau-
rants with initiatives to support their business. 
to support future growth, particular in the danish market and 
at the german border, the construction of a new high bay 
warehouse in faxe started in 2020 (expected to be put in use 
in 2021). the new facilities will increase the storage capacity 
significantly at the site and thus the flexibility of delivery to 
our customers.
in italy about 60% of our business is in on-trade. to part-
ly compensate for the effects of the significant decrease in 
sales during the periods with lockdowns and restrictions, we 
have focused on boosting our supermarket operations and 
ensuring that the wholesale and cash & carry channels were 
well-stocked and activated with our ceres and lemonsoda 
brands. ceres has in particular performed well in the off-
trade channel where we launched a range of speciality beer 
next to our iconic ceres strong ale. we have also actively 
supported bar owners in the periods between the lockdowns.  
in france, we focus on building a solid platform from which 
we can drive high value creation and with focus on in-store 
execution and e-commerce initiatives for our lorina brand. in 
2020, we reach all time high market share in lemonade, a cat-
egory which grew faster than the general soft drink market. 
during the covid-19 period, we have reached out to our con-
sumers online in both italy and france. in italy the italian 17.00 
ceres virtual apero event and in france the lorina mixer event 
each friday at 17.30 are just a few of many new occasions 
where our brands created happiness and new moments of 
enjoyment among consumers.
faxe kondi 
in denmark
2020 was a great year for our 
faxe kondi brand, especially 
for the 0 calories which grew 
56% in volume.
successful virtual 
beer tasting events
during the very unusual 2020, we have supported a number 
of initiatives to help our customers and local societies. one 
example is our virtual beer tasting events in denmark, 
where we promoted more than 30 local craft breweries 
and sold more than 500.000 of their beers.

in baltic sea, volumes for 2020 showed a 3% increase com-
pared to 2019 primarily due to the large beer campaign in 
finland in q4. net revenue showed a 2% decrease and was 
affected by the product and channel mix.
ebit increased to dkk 675 million and were dkk 21 million 
above the 2019 figure. the ebit margin increased by 1 percent-
age point from 19.8% in 2019 to 20.8% in 2020. the earnings de-
velopment was positively affected by tight cost management 
during the lockdown periods and the acquisition of bauskas.
“in a challenging year, we have benefited 
from our broad portfolio and have taken 
advantage of the growth in the low/no 
sugar/alco segments. the satisfactory 
results in 2020 can also be attributed to 
our ability to deliver the right products

the baltic sea segment was also impacted by the covid-19 
restrictions, but to a lesser extent as well as at a later stage 
for some of the countries compared to italy and denmark. 
due to a fast response and great flexibility, we succeeded to 
obtain an even better result than in the record year 2019, and 
at the same time we gained market share.
in finland, we continued the premiumization of our beer 
portfolio, with our brands aura, lahden erikois and lapin 
kulta pure. we also continued our efforts in the low/no sugar 
/alco area, including introducing a new lapin kulta 0.0%, and 
our portfolio delivered very strong growth rates. 
in the ready-to-drink category, original long drink con-
tinued to grow. the campaign “the greyest day of the year” 
reached 480.000 participants in 2020 compared to 200.000 
the year before and despite covid-19. in 2020, we continued 
our innovation adding new tastes and the original long shot 
to the portfolio.
in the baltics, we have been less impacted by covid-19 as we 
are less dependent on the on-trade channel in this region. 
cult energy was introduced to the market in 2020 and was 
well received by the consumers. the beer sale in lithuania 
and latvia has developed positively, supported by products 
from our latest acquisition bauskas, which are perform-
ing better than expected. the addition of bauskas in latvia 
has strengthened our multi-beverage model in the baltics. 
bauskas is now fully integrated into the business, which has 
strengthened our presence in the craft beer segment in the 
country. we have also successfully captured new customers 
in the on-trade segment as a result of the acquisition. 
on 1 march 2021, bauskas was moved to our group-wide sap 
system. 
zero zone in 
supermarkets
in all countries in the baltic sea segment we are gaining 
ground with our low/no beverage portfolio, with pepsimax 
leading the growth, and supported by our own strong local 
brands such as jaffa and enjoy.
to make the choice even more visible for consumers, we 
have established zero zone areas together with the super-
markets – efficiently presenting our no sugar and no alcohol 
products.

the impact from covid-19 has been fragmented in the inter-
national segment and we have seen countries in asia moving 
towards a more normal situation with a reopening of bars and 
restaurants faster than in countries in europe. 
with reference to the danish vikings, our faxe brand had a 
great year in 2020, especially in africa. we have built the brand 
over many years in close cooperation with our local distribut-
ers offering affordable premium products to the consumers. 
in 2020, we also supplemented the faxe brand with a non 
alcoholic variant with great taste.
the tempt cider brand continues to grow significantly in asia, 
where the covid-19 impact was mainly seen in the beginning 
of the year. 
the malt business is also performing well across countries, 
and we have invested in digital campaigns as well as new 
packaging formats to support the positioning of the malt 
brands. 
in 2021, we will focus on the areas that have performed in-

royal unibrew has focus on running its business 
and designing its management systems in accord-
ance with good corporate governance practices. the 
objective is to ensure that royal unibrew meets its 
obligations to shareholders, customers, employees, 
authorities and other stakeholders and that long-
term value creation is pursued.
 
the recommendations of the committee on corporate gov- 
ernance, current legislation and regulation within the area, 
best practices and internal rules provide the framework for 
royal unibrew’s corporate governance.
for the financial year 2020, royal unibrew has prepared a 
remuneration report in accordance with section 139b of the 
danish companies act. the report concludes that the remu-
neration of the board of directors and the executive manage-
ment has been provided in accordance with the remuneration 
policy and incentive guidelines of royal unibrew adopted by 
the agm on 28 april 2020.
royal unibrew established a whistleblower scheme in 2019 
for expedient and confidential notification of possible or sus-
pected wrong doings. in 2020, no whistleblower cases were 
reported.
royal unibrew’s website https://investor.royalunibrew.com/
corporate-governance  provides a detailed description of the 
board of directors’ approach to the corporate governance 
recommendations issued by the committee on corporate 
governance and designated by nasdaq copenhagen.
diversity and inclusion 
royal unibrew strives to promote diversity based on a con- 
viction that inclusion and diversity contributes to achieving 
royal unibrew’s vision and goals in a competitive global busi-
ness environment. this includes a diverse and strong blend 
of educational background work and life experience, diversity 
of beliefs, nationality and gender, both within the board of 
directors as well as in our respective management teams 
and our workforce in general. we believe that a diversified 
organization increases the versatility and total competences 
of the company and improves decision-making processes.
the international management team of royal unibrew – a 
total of 123 leaders – comprises 67% (2019: 68%) male and 
33% (2019: 32%) female. our target is a more balanced gender 
representation of at least 40% of each gender in the board 
of directors and international management teams. when 
recruiting new executives, we prioritize identifying candidates 
of both genders without discrimination and aim to encourage 
female candidates’ interest in taking on managerial tasks.
currently, the board of directors consists of six board mem-
bers elected by the agm and three board members elected by 
the danish based employees (all males). three of the mem-
bers elected by the agm are danish and three are non-dan-
ish. two of the agm elected board members are females.
we aim for the board of directors to consist of expert mem-
bers who should, to the widest extent possible, complement 
each other in terms of age, background, nationality, gender, 
etc., with a view to ensuring a competent and versatile con-
tribution to the board duties at royal unibrew. these mat-
ters are taking into consideration when the nomination and 
remuneration committee identifies new candidates for the 
policy on data ethics
pursuant to changes in the danish financial statements act 
listed companies are required to adopt a policy on data ethics 
and include a statement of the company’s policy in the annual 
report – or explain if the company does not have a data ethics 
policy. the new rules impose further obligations in addition to 
the gdpr and will apply from the financial year 2021. 
royal unibrew adopted its policy on data ethics in 2020. the 
policy establishes the overall guidelines and principles for how 
data ethics is considered and included in the use of data as well 
as design and implementation of technologies, especially new 
technologies, used for processing of personal data in royal 
unibrew. 
the policy is based on the 10 principles on data ethics adopted 
by the danish council for digital security (rådet for digital 
sikkerhed) and sets the general guidelines as well as specific 
details on relevant topics, e.g. legality, ethical design, conse-
quences of processing data, security, transparency and respect 
for human rights.  
the existing gdpr steering committee (cfo, cio, hr director 
and general counsel) is responsible for the data ethics policy 
and its implementation, while the practical compliance with the 
policy is incorporated in the existing data protection compliance 
program in royal unibrew. 
the data ethics statement will be included in the 2021 annual 
report.

board of directors, and it is an objective of the committee to 
identify both male and female candidates. however, recom-
mendation of candidates will always be based on an assess-
ment of the individual candidate’s competences and how he/ 
she will match royal unibrew’s needs and contribute to the 
overall efficiency of the board.
shareholder and stakeholder relations
royal unibrew’s management strives and works actively to 
maintain a good and transparent communication and dia-
logue with its shareholders and other stakeholders. we be-
lieve that a high level of transparency in the communication 
of information on the company’s development supports our 
work and a fair valuation of the company’s shares. our open-
ness is limited only by the duties of disclosure of nasdaq 
copenhagen and by competitive considerations.
the dialogue with and communication to shareholders and 
other stakeholders take place in connection with the pub-
lishing of financial reports and other announcements com-
municated via audio casts, meetings with investors, analysts 
and the media. financial reports and other announcements 
are available at royal unibrew’s website immediately after 
being published. our website also includes material used 
in connection with investor presentations and audio casts.
according to the articles of association of royal unibrew, 
general meetings shall be convened not more than five weeks 
and not less than three weeks prior to the general meeting. it 
is an objective to formulate the notice convening the meeting 
and the agenda in a way that gives shareholders an adequate 
presentation of the business to be transacted at the general 
meeting. proxies are limited to a specific general meeting 
and are formulated also to allow absent shareholders to give 
specific proxies for individual items of the agenda – either to 
the board of directors or to a person attending the general 
meeting. all documents relating to general meetings are 
published at royal unibrew’s website.
each share of a nominal value of dkk 2 entitles the holder 
to one vote. royal unibrew’s shares are not subject to any 
restrictions of voting rights, and the company has only one 
class of shares.
all shareholders may submit proposals for resolutions to 
the board of directors to be considered at the agm; such 
proposals for resolutions are to be received by the board of 
directors no later than six weeks prior to the date of the agm.
board of directors
the board of directors oversees the company’s overall strat-
egy and supervises the organizational, financial and perfor-
mance management of the company as well as continuously 
evaluates the work performed by the executive management 
on behalf of the shareholders.

of directors and the executive management. these rules of 
procedure are reviewed and updated annually by the board 
of directors.
the board of directors usually meets for six annual ordinary 
board meetings, of which at least one focuses on the compa-
ny’s strategy and prospects and one takes place in a market in 
which the company operates. in addition, the board members 
meet when required. in 2020, 12 board meetings were held.
the board of directors has established the following com-
mittees:
nomination and remuneration committee
the committee consists of the chairman and the deputy 
chairman of the board of directors. in 2020, the primary 
activities of the committee were the preparation of the an-
nual evaluation of the board of directors and the executive 
 management, the selection and nomination of potential new 
candidates for the board of directors, succession of the ceo, 
the  overall succession planning of the board of directors as 
well as assessment and recommendation of remuneration 
of the board of directors and the executive management. 
furthermore, the committee considered the implications of 
the implementation of the revised shareholder rights direc-
tive and prepared the remuneration report to be presented 
at the agm in 2021. the committee had 28 meetings in 2020.

audit committee
the committee consists of two members; the chairman

the low level of complexity of the business and wide usage 
of standard and automated it tools are the prime reasons 
for the size of the committee. it is the audit committee’s 
objective to secure quality and integrity in the company’s 
presentation of financial statements, audit and financial re-
porting. further, the audit committee monitors accounting 
and reporting processes, the audit of the company’s financial 
reporting, risk issues and the external auditor’s performance 
and independence.
moreover, the audit committee assesses and recommends to 
the board of directors election of external auditors. the ex-
ternal auditor has participated in all ordinary meetings of the 
audit committee. the committee held eight meetings in 2020.

evaluation of the work of the board of directors 
evaluation of the work of the board of directors takes place 
annually. the evaluation focuses on ensuring that the board 
of directors (as a body) has expertise and experience within 
fast moving consumer goods (fmcg), production, sales and 
marketing of brands globally and in business-to-business 
markets, strategic and general management and within eco- 
nomic, financial and capital market issues, including those 
relating to listed companies. the evaluation is facilitated by 
the chairman of the board of directors. for this purpose, 
the chairman receives written replies to a questionnaire 
distributed to all members of the board. the findings of the 
evaluation were presented and discussed at a board meeting 
and based on the 2020 evaluation it was concluded that the 
board of directors possesses the necessary competencies 
taken royal unibrew’s business model and strategy into con-
sideration.
an external consultant is involved in the evaluation at least 
every third year. an evaluation by an external consultant took 
place in 2020.
both the performance of the executive management and the 
cooperation between the board of directors and the  executive 
management are evaluated annually as a minimum.
composition of the board of directors
when composing the board of directors, we emphasize that 
the members have the competences required. the board of 
directors assesses its composition annually, ensuring that 
the combined competences and diversity of the members 
match the group’s activities.
candidates for the board of directors are recommended for 
election by the general meeting supported by motivation in 
writing by the board of directors as well as a description of 
the recruiting criteria. the individual members’ competences 
and credentials are described in the below section on the 
board of directors and the executive management. upon 
their election, the new board members are introduced to the 
company through a focused program.
election of members by the employees takes place in compli-
ance with the company law rules described at the company’s 
website. when joining the board of directors, the members 
elected by the employees are offered relevant training in 
serving on a board.

risk is an inherent part of business and we take an 
active approach to risk management, ensuring that 
our key risks are identified and mitigated in a struc-
tured and prioritized manner. royal unibrew has 
defined clear risk management processes, including 
policies and procedures, to strive to minimize the 
effect of our key risks as well as to protect our repu-
tation, values and freedom to operate.
the key enterprise risks are: market risks, industry and part-
nerships related risk, business interruption and third-party 
risks and financial risks. a detailed description of the financial 
risks is included in note 3.
we assess risks within each of the key risk areas based on 
their potential impact and likelihood. to ensure a sound and 
deeply rooted risk culture within the royal unibrew group, 
local risk owners as well as central risk owner from group 
functions are appointed to facilitate the risk identification, 
control and mitigation, supported by the central risk man-
agement function.
a challenging 2020 with covid-19
the royal unibrew multi-beverage model and risk manage-
ment setup have demonstrated their resilience over time and 
not at least in a time with covid-19 related uncertainties. 
however, the pandemic continues to challenge our employ-
ees, consumers and customers, placing additional require-
ments on our risk management and business planning. 
initiatives have been taken to ensure the safety of our em-
ployees during 2020, and we have succeeded not to close or 
reduce the production at any of our production sites during 
the pandemic. 
with restricted opening hours at bars and restaurants, closed 
nightlife, no larger events and festivals as well as closed 
borders between many of our home markets, extra support 
to customers and more frequent re-planning of production 
has been needed during 2020. 
to be able to meet changes in market demand, we continue to 
invest in our production sites, to secure sufficient production 
and storage capacity. our agile way of working has helped us 
to adjust to new opportunities both commercially and across 
the supply chain.

risk management structure and governance
royal unibrew’s risk management structure is based on a 
systematic process of risk identification, risk analysis and 
risk assessment. this structure provides a detailed overview 
of key risks relating to the realization of our strategies in the 
short and long term and enables royal unibrew to take the 
required measures to address risks.
the board of directors assesses the overall risk factors re-
lating to royal unibrew’s activities. risks are assessed under 
a two-dimensional “heat map” assessment system which 
estimates the impact of the risk in relation to profit, damage 
to royal unibrew’s reputation, violation of legislation or en-
vironmental implications as well as the likelihood of the risk 
resulting in an incident. based on the continuous assessment 
of potential risks, the ”heat map” is updated to bring a cur-
rent and better understanding of potential risks to ensure 
adequate mitigations efforts are initiated.
the identified risks and proposed action plans are reviewed 
and assessed by the company’s senior leadership team, 
whereas, the audit committee reviews the adequacy and the 
effectiveness of the risk management system. 
based on this the executive management presents the key 
risks to the board of directors and reports the necessary 
risk-mitigating activities/action plans for review. 
the overall risk management structure is outlined below.

key risk factors in 2021 
in addition to financial risks, the following risk factors are considered key risks in 2021:
area 
description
risk mitigation
 commodity 
prices 
and raw 
 materials
the prices of a large number of key commodities fluctuate in line with world market 
prices. to the extent that higher unit costs cannot be compensated for by higher 
selling prices per unit or in other ways of increasing the average selling price per 
unit correspondingly, royal unibrew’s earnings will decrease. the price fluctuation 
can also lead to deficiency of raw materials and effect royal unibrew's earnings 
negatively.
royal unibrew monitors the trend in commodity prices. hedging against short-term price increases 
takes place through agreements with suppliers and through commodity hedges with financial institu-
tions. the group’s policy for hedging commodity risks involves a smooth and time-differentiated effect 
of commodity price increases.
for 2021, more than 60% of our commodity price exposure is hedged.
industry
in most markets, the product categories beer and soft drinks are characterized by 
tough price competition and intensive marketing from a number of suppliers. the 
covid-19 pandemic has led to an increase in local e-commerce and entry of global 
e-commerce providers has opened new routes to customers.
royal unibrew’s earnings and competitiveness are ensured through constant focus on markets and 
segments in which royal unibrew holds or may achieve a significant position. our investment in digital 
solutions and the continuous improvements across the business will contribute towards limiting the 
negative effect from the changes in the industry. moreover, royal unibrew focuses on value manage-
ment through the development of products, containers and packaging, cooperation with customers 
and communication with consumers.
in 2020, we have launched a b2b e-commerce platform for our customers in denmark.  
it risks 
royal unibrew’s activities are to a large extent dependent on the use of the estab-
lished it systems and the quality of the applied it security solutions. a prolonged 
breakdown, unintended maloperation or an unauthorized break-in into the systems 
supporting sales and supply processes as well as internal information systems may 
involve a significant risk of interruption of royal unibrew’s activities.
royal unibrew works consistently to improve our it security and have established procedures to ensure:
• day-to-day operation of the it systems supporting the key business processes
• protection against data loss
• protection against unauthorized access to and distribution of confidential data
• general protection against cybercrime and securing physical access to ru facilities 
when acquiring companies, it is our risk philosophy to adopt the companies into our existing it system 
landscape and it security framework. on 1 march 2021, bauskas was integrated into royal unibrew's 
erp platform. 
macro-
economic
uncertainty
royal unibrew’s product portfolio is sold in markets and market areas where market 
developments are usually determined by long-cycle trends. macroeconomic uncer-
tainty, including changes of free trade agreements or low growth of long duration or 
outbreaks causing a threat to the public health, may affect earnings negatively. as a 
consequence of this we might experience declining consumption or shifts in product 
mix towards products in other packaging formats with lower earnings.
by focusing on flexibility in our action plans, royal unibrew is striving to get some leeway for reducing 
the effect of macroeconomic uncertainty and changes to consumption patterns.
the efforts directed at continuous improvements across the business will contribute towards limiting 
the negative effect of macroeconomic changes.
we continue to invest in our production set-up, including new can filling lines. 
partnership
royal unibrew cooperate with different partners across markets and product cate-
gories. changes to these relationships may affect the group’s sales and net revenue, 
and thus earnings.
royal unibrew has in general a long history with our partners and mitigate the partnership risk by 
entering into long term agreements and by providing adequate business results to ensure a mutually 
beneficial development of the partnerships.
statutory 
restrictions
royal unibrew’s activities are subject to national legislation in the markets in which 
royal unibrew operates. any legislative changes may impact the ability to operate,
e.g. by way of restrictions in respect of the sale, marketing, packing material and 
production of royal unibrew’s products or due to increasing consumption taxes. 
such restrictions may affect the group’s sales and earnings significantly.
royal unibrew participates in local and international cooperation fora within the brewery industry with 
a view to influencing legislative decision makers to ensure that conditions for producing and marketing 
beer and soft drinks do not deteriorate, and that consumption taxes are applied in a balanced manner.
weather 
the sale of royal unibrew’s products is dependent on weather conditions. usually, 
the consumption of royal unibrew’s products is highest in the summer months. 
however, this presupposes dry and fair weather. the weather in the summer of 2020 
is regarded as normal.
through focus on flexibility of action plans and production capacity, royal unibrew operates with a flex-
ible cost structure and can partly adjust to lower earnings caused by unfavorable weather conditions in 
the summer months, and at the same time ensuring the agility to support the customers in years with 
favorable weather.

to be the preferred choice for the future, we want to 
lead the beverage industry with respect to climate 
action and the demand for sustainable products. our 
focus is on reducing the impact of our operations and 
the entire value chain we are a part of while at the 
same time delivering sustainable business growth. 
during 2020, we stepped up on our ambitions when it comes 
to creating a sustainable business foundation and at the end 
of 2020, we finalized the work with our long-term sustaina-
bility strategy defining goals and kpis. royal unibrew wants 
to be the preferred local beverage partner. for us that entails 
providing sustainable products with great taste. the strategic 
focus being:
• our consumers & customers 
• our products
• our people 
for each of these areas, we have defined 2025 and 2030 com-
mitments complementing the short-term targets set in 2019. 
we aim for a substantial reduction in carbon emissions from 
the entire value chain, providing healthy, nutritious and re-
sponsible products (outperforming the market) and enabling 
a deeply engrained safety and sustainability culture at our 
company. 
we believe that it is of particular importance to transform our 
pledges and objectives into concrete plans and actions with 
goals, operational kpis and close follow-up. therefore, all 
our goals are supported by defined initiatives. 
in order to succeed with our ambitious sustainability strategy 
coordinated and wide-ranging efforts are needed – and we 
our new long-term sustainability strategy
cannot do it alone. we will innovate, develop and engage in 
partnerships for mutual benefit with our key stakeholders, 
such as strategic suppliers, major customers, consumers, 
local communities and our employees. in general, we are 
tracking well on our short term targets for 2022. due to cov-
id-19, the initiative on packaging waste in the americas, africa 
and asia was postponed.

csr – our new long-term
achievement highlights in 2020
we continued our sustainability journey in 2020 not only by developing the new long term strategy with ambitious targets, but also by continuing 
our efforts to reduce our footprints and potential impacts for our consumers/customers, our products and our people following up on our short 
term targets for 2022 and many other initiatives. 
establishing our new senior leadership 
team, appointing a senior vice president 
for hr and moving group csr reference 
to our ceo are major organizational im-
provements to ensure the right balance 
between commercial, people and sus-
tainability aspects.
our policy and objectives on diversity and 
inclusion was approved by the bod dur-
ing 2020. currently focusing on gender 
but to be expanded to other business 
critical aspects.
we are improving on diversity in our mar-
kets' management teams, where we are 
above 40% of the underrepresented gen-
der, i.e. women. an analysis of equal pay 
across the group shows that we do not 
have significant variation when compar-
ing pay to competences, seniority, age, 
gender, etc. 
collective bargaining and freedom of 
association is a basic right for all our 
employees, but in all the markets where 
we operate. royal unibrew is currently 
establishing an overview of the percent-
age of the workforce covered by collective 
agreements.
organizational 
development and diversity
we are currently awaiting approvals to 
build a solar park in faxe, denmark, 
aiming at providing 100% renewable en-
ergy for our entire power consumption in 
denmark. in addition, we are looking at 
geo-thermal energy project at our lahti 
site in finland.
investing in renewable 
energy
royal unibrew has succeeded in decou-
pling volume growth from carbon emis-
sions. in the period from 2015 to 2020, 
we have had a decrease of 22% kgco₂/
hl while having a volume increase of 
23%. our success is a combination of 
our keen focus on optimizing our energy 
consumption year-on-year, the positive 
results of phase one of a large energy 
efficiency project at our lahti site in 
finland and specifically between 2019 
and 2020 there was a change in product 
mix due to covid-19 with a shift from 
the more energy consuming brewing 
process to less energy consuming soft 
drinks production.
royal unibrew’s production facilities are 
not located in water scarce areas, but 
as water is an important raw material 
for us, water preservation and quality 
are key. reducing water consumption 
remains a priority and the consumption 
of water per hl has decreased by 4% from 
2015 to 2020 and in a like-to-like compar-
ison by 10%.
decoupling growth  
year-on-year
all our primary packaging contains information on 
material, recycling and deposit return, which is one 
of the ways we engage with consumers to close the 
loop. the effect can be measured in the year on 
year improving return rates in the well-functioning 
deposit return systems in finland, denmark and 
lithuania. from 2018 to 2019 the overall increase 
in returned cans and bottles was 2-3 % on average 
across the three markets. the return rate in 2019 
was in a range of 90 to 94% for pet, 90 to 95 % for 
cans and for glass between 84 to 88%. 
royal unibrew is working on down gauging (re-
moving) unnecessary material and increasing the 
content of recycled material in all our markets. 
resulting in a reduced carbon footprint from pack-
aging and elimination of unnecessary material. in 
the table on short term targets on packaging ma-
terial, we have indicated the achievements across 
the royal unibrew on r-pet (19%), r-paper (69%) 
and r-carton (75%). a few examples of material 
reduction we did in 2020 was e.g. down gauging of 
a standard 33cl can, resulting in annual material 
savings of 57 ton alumina. another example is re-
duction in plastic material in pet bottles, where 
we in one market alone are saving 8 ton plastic per 
year by a design change. a third example is trays 
where we in dk alone, have reduced the corrugated 
carton by 216 ton per year.
packaging materials reused, 
reduced and recycled 
royal unibrew wants to provide choice 
for the consumers, but we are aware 
of the global challenges formulated by 
who regarding obesity as well as alco-
hol abuse. we take our responsibility very 
seriously, in our product declaration, in 
our marketing of products and not the 
least when we develop new products. we 
want to offer products with great taste 
for every occasion, including a balanced 
launch of regular, no and low products 
in different categories. between 2017 and 
2020, the volume growth for no and low 
products out-performed regular prod-
ucts, significantly for both soft drinks, 
beer, cider and rtd. for our csd, water 
and energy portfolio, this is also reflect-
ed in a 7% general reduction in calory 
content per 100 ml across our markets 
during the same period. for beer, rtd 
and cider the average alcohol percentage 
are clearly reduced in denmark, finland 
and the baltics between 3 to 5%.

2019
royal unibrew is a strong regional beverage company, found-
ed on local anchored facilities, employees and sourcing of 
materials and services. we aim to provide successful, sus-
tainable brands that people trust and therefore, we have 
always been committed to contributing positively to the de-
velopment in the areas in which we operate, to limiting our 
environmental impact, to establishing safe and good working 
conditions for our employees and to delivering high quality 
products to consumers.
we also realize that being regional but with global markets, 
we continuously need to improve our efforts and having a 
sustainability scope encompassing the entire value chain 
across our markets.
our sustainability approach is underpinned by royal uni-
brew’s purpose and strategy, the un global compact (ungc) 
principles and the un sustainable development goals (sdgs). 
a strong company culture is crucial for our ongoing progress 
– a culture in which decisions are taken with respect to our 
customers’, suppliers’ and other key stakeholders’ views and

at royal unibrew, we are committed to conducting our business in a sustainable,  
responsible and ethical way. 
priorities, and which encourages people to take responsibility 
for their actions. we believe that this approach will help us 
continuously to integrate sustainability deeper into our or-
ganization and to realize our ambitious targets. 
during 2020, we worked intensively to reach our short-term 
sustainability targets for 2020-2022 within selected areas such 
as alcohol and sugar content in new products, co2 emission 
for activities ‘inside our fence’ and packaging material as 
well as lost time incident frequency. furthermore, we con-
tinued our endeavors towards establishing a well-defined 
and transparent corporate social responsibility framework 
and as planned, we have formulated our new longer-term 
sustainability strategy, including specific long-term targets.

policies and systems
royal unibrew is working in accordance with international  
and national legislation as well as international guidelines, 
conventions and standards for corporate social responsibility 
(csr) and sustainability. our policies and systems at either 
group or country level ensures that we conduct our business 
in accordance with regulatory requirements and guidelines.
all our production sites are operating in accordance with 
internationally recognized quality standards and all sites are 
food safety certified, in accordance with standards recognized 
by gfsi (global food safety initiative). in addition, we have a 
systematic approach to environment, health and safety, where 
several sites are certified, too.
royal unibrew’s ethics policy and our code of conduct provide 
guidance for our employees, third parties acting on behalf 
of the company and suppliers regarding anti-corruption, 
environment, human rights and labor standards but also 
gdpr (general data protection regulation), competition and 
marketing law. the basic requirement for royal unibrew is 
being in legal compliance, i.e. having the right mechanisms 
to ensure that we have no violations.
internal controls and the whistle-blower scheme are impor-
tant means for controlling and reporting potential irregulari-
ties also by external stakeholders. regular training is among 
the tools to ensure compliance internally, thus employees are 
trained in relevant aspects depending on their function inside 
and outside of the company.

executive management
our sustainability activities, including the formulation of our 
sustainability policies and targets, are anchored at the board 
of directors, which sets the direction for our strategy, targets 
and group policies together with the executive management. 
the targets are aligned by and implemented through the 
growth leadership team. to ensure focus on sustainability, 
group csr reports directly to ceo.
signing up to the un global compact in 2019 was the starting 
point for further formalization of our sustainability efforts, 
including further improvement of transparency in our sus-
tainability policies, systems and due diligence processes, and 
these efforts were intensified during 2020.
establishing clear accounting policies for sustainability indi-
cators and thus establishing the basis for transparency and 
external assurance has been an integral part of this process. 
group csr and finance are responsible for measuring our re-
sults including good practice guidelines for risk and controls. 
based on the accounting policies, a control framework will 
be established to ensure a consistent quality in our reports 
and documentation. 
we strive to work with a balanced approach towards our 
stakeholders, both by disclosing potential risks to our busi-
ness and how we control these, as well as by showing the 
opportunities for royal unibrew; commercially, as a sustain-
able beverage company and locally a sustainable partner and 
not the least as a great place to work.
our governance structure
we have implemented policies and procedures to minimize 
risks from our activities and to ensure our freedom to operate. 
compliance with legal and other requirements, including our 
ethical policy, is fundamental. potential risks may include 
food safety incidents, workplace incidents, human rights vi-
olations in the value chain or failure to attract and retain the 
right employees preventing our business from expanding. 
market availability of recycled packaging material, lack of 
well-functioning waste collection and recycling systems, un-
intentional emissions or inefficient processes are the main 
environmental risks.

health & nutrition
being a responsible company, royal unibrew is aware of the 
global challenges formulated by who regarding obesity and 
the associated risks of cardiovascular diseases, cancer and 
diabetes as well as risk of alcohol abuse, linked to excess 
consumption of food and beverages.
we strive to offer consumers and customers sustainable 
enjoyment through a broad variety of beverages, comple-
menting the setting/situation whether the individuals find 
themselves at a music venue, dining with family and friends, 
exercising, travelling or at other occasions. the purpose is 
to provide energy, refreshment, quenching thirst or simply 
a good time. consequently, we develop, launch and supply 
products with great taste and with regular, low/no-alcohol 
and calorie content, all clearly declared. our aim is  to of-
fer a low/no alternative in all categories and in all markets 
to enable our customers to offer healthier choices to the 
consumers. royal unibrew also wants to lead development 
of healthy and nutritious products and markets, not only by 
offering new products and outperforming market growth but 
also by investing in more information and communication 
about the products. 
during recent years, royal unibrew has across the group 
introduced more low/no sugar alternatives compared to regu-
lar, e.g. full sugar, products in the soft drink, water and energy 
categories. the volume of low/no sugar products increased 
by 37% from 2017 to 2020, while regular products increased 
by only 17% in the same period, which indicates our short-
term 2022 target of a balanced launch of regular, low and no 
beverages is working.
we believe in the consumer’s choice. we want to help consumers make the healthy or nutritious choice by always having an alternative 
to regular products, e.g. fully sugared, alcoholic, etc. we want to provide transparency for the consumer when choosing.
•  offer a no/low alterna-
tive in all categories
•  reduce sugar/kcal/ 
alcohol per serving 
•  promote responsible 
drinking
key initiatives
the production of 0.0% and low alcohol containing products 
(beer, cider and rtd) increased across the group in 2020 ac-
commodating the general consumer trend. the no-alcohol 
segment increased by 265% from 2017 to 2020 compared to a 7% 
increase for low alcohol containing products and unchanged or 
slightly reduced growth for strong and regular in the same pe-
riod, which indicates our 2022 target of increasing the number 
of beverages with 0.0% and low alcohol will be met.
over the coming years, we will continue with a balanced de-
velopment and launch of regular and reduced – both low and 
no – content of alcohol and sugar in our beverages.
responsible drinking
we support national and international trade associations, 
such as brewers’ of europe’s views and guidelines on respon-
sible drinking. in addition, we support a large variety of sports 
and health initiatives through our sponsorships regionally 
and locally. in finland, for example, all beer sponsorships 
will be converted into 0.0% alcohol beer. our responsibility 
for products containing alcohol is to prioritize quality and 
value over quantity.
we will continue to promote responsible drinking through 
support and participation in relevant programs and partner-
ships regionally. this also applies for sugar contents, where 
we participate actively in partnerships looking at ways to re-
duce calorie content in soft drinks.

corporate social responsibility
today, all royal unibrew’s primary packaging material has 
information on either deposit return or labels on recycling. 
some of the secondary packaging contains this information 
as well. it is our objective to expand the product information 
not only to include packaging material information but by 
2030 to include sustainability information from the entire 
value chain as well. 
however, information is not enough in itself. for the well-func-
tioning deposit return systems (drs) there are generally very 
high return rates, e.g. +90% in denmark and finland. but 
10% is still lacking and in markets with poor or non-existing 
drs, the challenge is much bigger. therefore, we will step 
up on engaging consumers in closing the loop, thus, ena-
bling food grade material for recycling. recycling campaigns 
are currently run together with the deposit return systems 
(drs) in denmark, finland and lithuania, and it is our plan 
to conduct campaigns on waste reduction and circularity in 
large markets by 2025 to increase consumer awareness on 
recycling. in fact, this also applies to our customers, where 
awareness and handling of secondary packaging especial-
ly in export markets, must be improved. the activities may 
involve support for local initiatives for improving/developing 
the infrastructure.
in the market circularity
we want to become circular across the value chain by engaging consumers and customers.  
we will close the material loop, reduce the strain on resources and reduce our footprint.
•  reduce food waste
•  engage consumers in 
closing the loop
•  develop infrastructure

local engagement
as a strong regional multi-beverage company, it is in our 
dna to engage not only in the local societies surrounding our 
premises, sports clubs, employees’ families but also in our 
brand communities, with customers, other business partners 
and ngos. 
we strive to provide successful brands that people trust and 
therefore, we have always been committed to contributing 
positively, wherever we operate and are connected. we be-
lieve, it is part of our responsibility and value as a company 
to drive, develop and support sustainability efforts through 
relevant touch points. local sourcing of ingredients and 
developing local products are other examples of our local 
engagement. 
royal unibrew has a number of on-going local engagements 
with local sports clubs, the local music scenes, city festivals, 
etc. we want to make these interactions sustainable. this also 
applies to music festivals and large sports events, where we 
participate. the initiatives encompass concepts introduc-
ing reusable cups, making your own energy in the “festival 
reactor”, introducing organic beverages (beer, csd, rtd), 
sponsorships with 0.0 beer, supporting local lake preservation 
in lahti (finland), supporting circularity mindset through a 
student oriented “beer for pre-owned furniture” concept and 
the local connection is in our dna – we want to be present in the local communities 
with local brands and products, actively engaging through the activities we support.
many more only partly tested in 2020. our goal is that at least 
50% of our engagements include sustainability elements by 
2030, and for large events we are even more ambitious with 
70% already in 2025.
supporting local businesses in general is another important 
undertaking for royal unibrew. during the pandemic this has 
become even more pertinent, especially in relation to on-
trade and events. like many other beverage companies, we 
have assisted with alcohol for sanitizers and various support 
for health workers and other frontline personnel. in addi-
tion, we quickly engaged in activating consumers using our 
platforms and channels together with various customers for 
‘take away’, we launched the ‘together together’ campaign 
and ceres bar supporter in bars and restaurants and was the 
main driver behind denmark’s biggest virtual beer tasting 
supporting micro-breweries.

improving energy efficiency
at our production site in lahti, finland, we have successfully implemented phase 1 of our energy 
optimization project. 
the project is mainly considering reducing thermal energy consumption for hvac (heat, ventilation & aircon-
ditioning), cip (clean in place) and pasteurization, resulting in a reduction of at least 1,200 ton co₂ per year. 
in phase 2, we are expecting even higher reductions by utilizing geo-thermal energy and/or by utilizing fuel 
sources based on renewables.

renewable energy sources
royal unibrew is setting ambitious targets on carbon emis-
sions. from our own production (scope 1 and 2) we aim at 
being carbon emission free in 2025, and for the entire supply 
chain reducing our footprint by at least 50% in 2030. we have 
decided on several initiatives to reach these ambitious tar-
gets, but we also acknowledge that implementation of new, 
not yet available technologies, are key to succeed.
for the multi-beverage industry, the main part of the co₂ 
footprint is ’outside the fence’. therefore, we need to work not 
only on scope 1 and 2 ‘inside the fence’ but as well on scope 
3 ‘outside the fence’. 
we will increase our renewable energy use towards 2030, starting from our own 
production and gradually increasing demands on suppliers.
•  transform and electrify 
production
•  demand renewable 
energy in the supply 
chain
•  optimize energy and 
water consumption
key initiatives
royal unibrew’s principles for reducing carbon footprint is 
to work continuously with optimizations to increase energy 
efficiency. based on the general consensus on the need to 
transform and electrify production processes, we will apply 
and invest in new technologies, when available and commer-
cially viable. investing actively in or pushing for additionality 
of renewable energy in the grid is included as well. the most 
pertinent challenge for the industry is transforming thermal 
processes to power-based processes. the technologies to 
heat/cool efficiently by power are, however, not available, yet. 
principles for reducing co2 
emission from production is:
1   reduce energy consumption/increase 
energy efficiency
2   investing in transformation of thermal 
energy to electrical energy
3   actively invest in or push for additionally

our ambition to become emission free or reducing the im-
pact significantly will also translate into new demands for 
our suppliers and partners across the entire value chain. 
potential symbiosis and new business models in our local 
communities which also links into product circularity will 
also be part of the solution.
to support the transition towards using renewable energy 
we are investigating the possibility of constructing a solar 
park, covering our danish power consumption, and in finland, 
we are investigating solutions using geo-thermal energy for 
heating and for biogas replacing natural gas in our boilers. 
transportation is another area where technologies for heavy 
duty transportation still are rather immature. the offering and 
availability of renewable fuel sources are gradually increasing 
but there are still major technological challenges in becoming 
carbon emission free. the industry currently estimates a 
potential of 30% reduction in 2030. royal unibrew is currently 
looking at fossil free fuels as transitional options as well as

in 2020, the co₂ impact from production, packaging materials 
and distribution was 36, 143, 30 million kg co₂, respectively. 
essentially unchanged from 2019 in absolute amount but with 
an improvement per produced unit of 2 to 3% for transpor-
tation and packaging material. the reduction for packaging 
materials is triggered by increasing the content of recycled 
material.
the carbon footprint for our production was reduced by 22%, 
measured as kg co₂ per produced volume, from the base year 
2015 to 2020. being above our 2020 target of 15% co₂ reduction 
and showing we are on the right track for our target of 30% 
in 2022 compared to 2015. between 2019 and 2020, the kg co₂ 
per produced volume decreased with 12%. the co₂ reduction 
is a result of phase 1 of energy optimization project in lahti in 
combination with a shift in product mix, i.e. during the pan-
demic there has been a significant increase in the soft drink 
production volume relative to beer production.
water is our most important raw material and therefore 
water preservation and water quality are key to us. all our 
wastewater is treated before emission either at our site or 
at the municipal treatment plant to meet the requirements. 
reducing water consumption remains a priority to us and 
the consumption of water per hl has decreased by 4% from 
2015 to 2020 and in a like-to-like comparison with 10%. royal 
unibrew’s production facilities are not located in water scarce 
areas, and some of our sites do not have full separation of 
rainwater and process water, resulting in a larger waste-
water discharge than actual. and at our site in italy, we use 
well water for the last rinse in the cleaning process and it 
is essentially not contaminated water but is accounted for 
as consumption. we only use municipal or own well water 
at our sites.

100% recycled pet
use of recycled packaging material 
has been increasing over the last 
couple of years – and will increase 
significantly towards 2025. for exam-
ple, our egekilde water brand is now 
in 100% recycled pet, lapin kulta and 
royal organic is packed with 100% 
recycled shrink film, ceres is with 
100% recycled paper labels and our 
faxe kondi booster in 100% recycled 
corrugated trays.
product circularity
in the beverage industry product circularity depends to a high 
degree on closing the loop for packaging material (primary, 
secondary and tertiary). the elements are to remove, reduce, 
reuse and recycle material. 
the food safety requirements for primary packaging material 
(e.g. glass bottles, pet bottles and cans) are stringent as it is 
key to protect our products. the entire packaging system, e.g. 
bottles, crates, trays and wraps ensures there is no harm to 
our products during distribution, and packaging is therefore 
key to product protection and avoiding food waste. thus, the 
packaging systems are complex, and substituting or eliminat-
ing elements such as plastic wrap or down-weighting require 
careful testing to ensure continued stability. 
we continuously cooperate with our suppliers on reducing the 
weight of material/amount of material used per item. we have 
already reduced pet weight by 20% over a 10-year period and 
reduced aluminum in cans by 5%. in our secondary system, 
cardboard is being reduced as well. the work continues and 
we are in a process of setting concrete targets together with 
our suppliers.
furthermore, we have worked on increasing the amount of 
recycled pet in our bottles for several years. in 2019, we set 
short term targets for 2020 and 2022 for selected catego-
ries and with our new strategy, we are setting even higher 
we want to become circular across the value chain by engaging suppliers. we will 
close the material loop, reduce the strain on resources and reduce our footprint.
•  eliminate unneces-
sary packaging (incl. 
plastics)
•  source recycled  
packaging material
•  become the  
sustainable partner
key initiatives
ambitions with a target of 100% recycled material for more 
categories in 2025 and even more by 2030. we estimate that 
the transitioning from virgin to recycled packaging will reduce 
our co2 footprint for packaging material by more than 40%.  
it is our target only to offer products in recyclable packaging 
in all our markets by 2025. in principle, we only use mono 
materials today. mono materials can easily be separated, 
sorted and recycled in clean fractions such as glass, pet, 
carton, aluminum, steel and shrink film. however, our juice 
portfolio, contributing 0.001% of packing materials in 2020 on 
weight basis, is currently provided in coated carton, i.e. more 
complex laminated materials. while the recyclability of that 
particular material may be improved over the next couple of 
years, we will however, also be looking at alternatives.
reuse of materials is also an important part of ensuring 
product circularity. there is well-established reuse systems 
for packaging material in several of our markets, e.g, return 
systems for glass bottles, crates, steel kegs and pallets. how-
ever, such systems are not in place in all markets. well-func-
tioning deposit return systems (drs) are in place in denmark, 
finland and lithuania and similar systems are currently being 
discussed in france, latvia and italy. we will continue our 
support to drs in our major markets to increase the return 
rate further and look for solutions to avoid packaging wasting 
in other markets with more immature systems.

business units showed an enormous flexibility and agility in 
meeting the unprecedented challenges related to the global 
covid-19 pandemic. developing our ability to lead remotely 
and building resilience as a response to the covid uncer-
tainties was in focus the entire year. 
in finland, italy, and france an engagement survey was con-
ducted in december 2020. the results demonstrated an even

senior leadership team.
the new recruits in hartwall 
we recruited the second group of graduates 
in 2020. in short, the idea is to recruit young 
potentials every year who enter a two-year 
trainee program. they are offered a “real” 
role in the business which changes after the 
first year and furthermore, their developed is 
supported by a number of activities in addition 
to their specific role. after two years, they get 
a permanent position in the organization. this 
is an example of how we work to attract young 
talents and at the same time support social 
responsibility.

diversity, equality & inclusion
we want our organization to reflect the diversity of today’s 
society and we believe that a more diverse, equal and inclu-
sive workforce creates the best and most dynamic workplace 
climate, as well as it supports innovation and long-term value 
creation for all our stakeholders.
continuous efforts are made to ensure workplace diversity 
and inclusion. traditionally, the beverage industry is rela-
tively male-dominated, but royal unibrew strives on an on-
going basis to ensure a more equal gender representation. 
we measure gender diversity in international management 
teams and at the board of directors. the number of women 
at the board of directors is 2 out of 6 members elected by 
the shareholders. in our international management teams, 
we improve gender diversity year after year.
our target is a more balanced gender representation of at 
least 40% of each gender by 2024 and the same applies to 
the board of directors. when recruiting new executives and 
managers, we prioritize identifying without discrimination 
and aim to encourage female candidates’ interest in taking 
on managerial tasks. several other initiatives were carried 
out, such as approval of our policy and objectives on diversity 
and inclusion by the board of directors and an improvement 
project on employee master data to improve the foundation 
for our d&i priorities. diving into the gender diversity and 
inclusion performance as an effect of our initiatives, there 
is a very positive trend in our management teams at our dif-
diversity, equality and inclusion is a fundamental part of sustainability. we want a 
diverse, equal and inclusive company providing resilience and driving innovation.
•  ensure/enable a 
culture of equality 
and inclusion valuing 
diversity
•  become a driver of 
equality and inclusion in 
the local communities
key initiatives
ferent markets, where we for the past two consecutive years 
are above the 40% target, at 43% on average in 2020 of the 
underrepresented gender, i.e. women, compared to our inter-
national management teams average of 33% in 2020, which 
has also improved year on year.
we also work on promoting other diversity aspects for exam-
ple by including people that for various reasons struggle to 
maintain or get a foothold on the job market. in the coming 
years we will focus on two initiatives: the first is to analyze 
where diversity is specifically challenging seen from a busi-
ness critical angle being gender, competences, age, seniority, 
ethnicity, etc., supported by data, and the second is to work 
on maintaining an inclusive culture.

safe workplace mindset 
a good working environment is a safe working environment, 
and that is a top priority for royal unibrew. we focus on min-
imizing risks and raising awareness about health and safety 
for all our employees and take preventive measures to avoid 
employees being worn out and incurring work-related injuries 
– and we recognize that one accident is one to many.
when deploying our sustainability strategy, we will enhance 
our efforts to support behavioral based safety and employee 
well-being (where harassment is a focus area) we see that 
as fundamental for maintaining and further developing our 
safety mindset and culture. with the aim to move towards 
zero lost time incidents, all employees will be trained in be-
havior-based safety, including increasing the transparency 
of root cause assessments to improve learning, as well as 
linking safety to bonus targets.
safety is a prerequisite for taking care of employees and ensuring that they can be something for other people outside 
of work. to be successful in our safety efforts this needs to be a mindset and something our employees live by every day.
•  create a harassment 
free working environ-
ment
•  ensure employee 
wellbeing
•  further develop our 
safety culture
key initiatives
local focus and initiatives have resulted in a continued re-
duction in lost time incidents per 1 million working hours 
(lti frequency) by 30% from 2015 to 2018 and has leveled out 
between 2018 and 2019. the lti frequency unfortunately in-
creased between 2019 and 2020 from 10.8 to 13.7. the target 
of 20% reduction in 2020 compared to 2018 was therefore not 
met. root cause assessments indicate that behavior is the 
main reason for incidents. we believe the increase may at 
least in part, be explained by the job rotation between on-
trade and off-trade as a result of covid-19, where employees 
from other functions assisted in off-trade and the unusual 
sales situation may have stressed the organization as well. 
working overtime more than usual may be an additional fac-
tor. we will enhance our behavioral-based safety training 
and awareness in 2021 across the group to reduce the lti 
frequency.
harassment free working environment 
in connection with our on-going dialogue in the production area, 
we have identified a need for addressing and increasing awareness 
of potentially abusive acts and harassment to improve well-being. 
royal unibrew has zero tolerance, and we have just launched a 
new initiative governed by our well-being groups to facilitate our 
journey towards zero. the objective is to create an environment, 
where everyone not only has the right to speak up but also feel 
comfortable, when they point at a lack of consideration from a 
colleague, including managers. 
lost time incidents 
accidents per million work hours
“further development 
of the safety culture 
by using humor is the 
philosophy behind our 
“safety thirst” campaign 
developed together with 
employees from various 
business functions. the 
campaign is currently 
being rolled out.”

note 1: basis for preparation
royal unibrew a/s has developed a csr data reporting manual encom-
passing roles and responsibilities, data scope, reporting, controls and 
documentation requirements as well as a detailed description of each 
key performance indicator.
note 2: our consumers/customers
the data disclosed as target follow up for 2020 to 2022 is based on actual 
sales volume in the period from 2017 to 2020, divided into no/low and 
regular kcal content for the categories carbonated soft drinks, water 
and energy and for alcohol content (beer, cider and rtd) no and low 
compared to regular and strong. the sales volumes are used as an 
assessment of a balanced development and launch of new no/low and 
regular products.
note 3: our products
royal unibrew has reported on environmental performance for a num-
ber of years. therefore, data are available from 2015. the data has been 
corrected to the reporting requirements mentioned in note 1.
acquisitions in 2018 and 2019 increased our absolute comsumptions. 
despite acquisitions in 2018 and 2019 the absolute and relative consump-
tion of energy decreased slightly from 2015 to 2020 and the associated 
co2 emissions as well. the energy consumption per hectoliter and 
the co2 emission per hectoliter decreased significantly compared to 
2015 (baseline for the 2020/22 targets) by 20% and 22%, respectively. 
if corrected for the acquired sites, the co2 emission decreased 24%. 
the improvement is due to a keen focus on energy reduction projects.
the consumption of water per hectoliter has decreased by 3% compared 
to 2015, and more than 10%, if corrected for the acquisitions. whereas 
the absolute consumption of water has levelled out from 2018 to 2020.
we have for the second time calculated the co2 emission for transpor-
tation (downstream), including ghg scope 1 and scope 3, i.e. owned 
and leased vehicles as well as third party forwarders measured as kg 
co2 eq. the calculation is based on industry standards and direct input 
from our forwarders. it is estimated that at least 80% of the footprint 
is accounted for, but further data development is needed. the same 
applies to our co2 emission from packaging material. 
note 4: our people
royal unibrew a/s has collected data for lost time incidents (lti) and 
disclosed information in our annual report since 2015. the data has 
been corrected to the new reporting requirements mentioned in note 1. 
there may be underreporting of ltis as the focus traditionally has 
been on registering incidents for production/ware housing and to a 
lesser degree distribution, sales and administration. we will continue 
our focus in this area.
as it may be noted other relevant data for occupational health and safety 
performance has only been collected for 2018 to 2020, as the recording 
has been lacking at some entities before that. the same applies to 
employee engagement and diversity.

opinion 
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent company financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the group’s and the parent company’s assets, 
liabilities and financial position at 31 december 2020 and of 
the results of the group’s and parent company’s operations 
and cash flows for the financial year 1 january – 31 december 
2020 in accordance with the international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu and additional requirements 
in the danish financial statements act. 
our opinion is consistent with our long-form audit report to 
the board or directors and the audit committee.
audited financial statements
royal unibrew a/s’ consolidated financial statements and 
separate financial statements for the financial year 1 january 
– 31 december 2020 comprise the income statement, state-
ment of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of 
changes in equity, statement of cash flows and notes, includ-
ing summary of significant accounting policies, for the group 
as well as for the parent company (the financial statements). 
the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the 
international financial reporting standards as adopted by 
the eu and additional requirements in the danish financial 
statements act.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international 
standards on auditing (isas) and the additional requirements 
applicable in denmark. 
our responsibilities under those standards and requirements 
are further described in the “auditor’s responsibilities for 
the audit of the financial statements” section of our report.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf-
ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance with the in-
ternational ethics standards board for accountants’ code 
of ethics for professional accountants (iesba code) and the 
additional requirements applicable in denmark, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these rules and requirements. 
we declare, to the best of our knowledge and belief, that 
we have not provided any pro-hibited non-audit services, as 
referred to in article 5(1) of the regulation (eu) 537/2014 and 
that we remained independent in conducting the audit. 
appointment as auditors
we were appointed auditors of royal unibrew a/s for the first 
time on 24 april 2018 for the financial year 2018. we have been 
reappointed annually by shareholder resolution for a total 
period of uninterrupted engagement of three years including 
the financial year 2020.
statement on the management’s review
management is responsible for the management’s review. 
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
management’s review, and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the management’s review and, 
in doing so, consider whether the management’s review is 
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated. 
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the man-
agement’s review provides the information required under the 
danish financial statements act. 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
the management’s review is in accordance with the financial 
statements and has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the danish financial statement act. we did 
not identify any material misstatement of the management’s 
review.
management’s responsibility for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of financial 
statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with 
the international financial reporting standards as adopted 
by the eu and additional requirements in the danish financial 
statements act and for such internal control that manage-
ment determines is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstate-
ment, whether due to fraud or error. 
in preparing the financial statements, management is 
 responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent com-
pany’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless management  either 
intends to liquidate the group or the parent company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

key audit matters
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
valuation of intangible assets 
goodwill and trademarks represent 51% of the group’s assets. management conducts annual im-
pairment test to determine whether the carrying values of recognised goodwill and trademarks are 
considered to be impaired and, hence, should be written down to the recoverable amount. 
management determines the recoverable amount of the cash generating units (cgus) using a dis-
counted cash flow model (value in use). management uses key assumptions in respect of market and 
country risks, revenue and margin development and discount rate for the cgus. 
the audit of the recoverable amount has been considered a key audit matter as the determina-tion of 
the recoverable value is associated with significant estimation uncertainty.
the carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries in the parent company’s separate financial state-
ments and the values of intangible assets contained therein is also tested to identify any impairment. 
this is the same test as described above.
reference is made to note 11 in the consolidated financial statement and note 11 in the parent com-
pany financial statements.
for the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:
•  we have discussed with management and evaluated the internal controls and procedures for 
preparing impairment tests and the budget and forecasts.
•  we have focused our audit on the models and the appropriateness of key assumptions used by 
management to calculate the values in use, as well as defined cgus and assessed the consistency 
of the assumptions applied. 
•  we have assessed the appropriateness of the discount rates applied and underlying assumptions, 
as well as benchmarking to market data and external information.
•  our internal valuation specialists have supported the audit where relevant.
•  in addition, we have assessed whether the disclosures; note 11 intangible assets in the 
consolidated financial statements meet the requirements of ifrs.
revenue recognition
there are a significant number of transactions and contracts with customers.
sales contracts with customers are relatively complex with discounts and agreements with marketing
contributions etc. 
furthermore locally imposed duties and fees are complex. 
overall this introduce an inherent risk to revenue recognition process. therefore we have considered 
this as a key audit matter.
reference is made to note 5 in the consolidated financial statements.
for the purpose of our audit, the procedures we carried out included the following:
•  we have considered the appropriateness of the group’s revenue recognition policy and assessed 
the compliance with ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers.
•  we have evaluated the systems and key controls, designed and implemented by management, 
related to revenue recognition. 
•  we have discussed with management the key judgements related to recognition, measurement and 
classification of revenue
•  in addition, we have performed substantive procedures. we have discussed significant and complex 
customer contracts, locally imposed duties and fees and the development in discounts and the 
treatment of marketing contribution to ensure that accounting policies are applied correctly. 
• we have performed journal-entries testing and verification of proper cut-off at year-end. 
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for the 2020 financial year. these matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in the forming of our opinion thereon. we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

auditor’s responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance as to 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. reasona-
ble assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guaran-
tee that an audit conducted in accordance with isas and the 
additional requirements applicable in denmark will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. misstatements 
may arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these financial statements. 
as part of an audit conducted in accordance with isas and the 
additional requirements applicable in denmark, we exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. we also:
•  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or er-
ror, design and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omis-
sions, misrepresentations or the override of internal 
control.
•  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the pur-
pose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
group’s and the parent company’s internal control. 
•  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management. 
•  conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material unc-
er-tainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the group’s and the parent 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern. if 
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the financial statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opin-
ion. our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. however, 
future events or conditions may cause the group and 
the parent company to cease to continue as a going 
concern. 
•  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and con-
tents of the financial statements, including the disclo-
sures, and whether the financial statements represent 
the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
gives a true and fair view. 
•  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the group to express an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. we are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit. we remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion. 
we communicate with those charged with governance re-
garding, among other matters, the planned scope and tim-
ing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
we also provide those charged with government with a state-
ment that we have complied with relevant ethical require-
ments regarding independence, and communicate to them 
all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be 
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards. 
from the matters communicated to those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and therefore the key audit matters. we de-
scribe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determined that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.
report on compliance with the esef regulation
as part of our audit of the consolidated financial state-
ments and parent company financial statements of royal 
unibrew a/s we performed procedures to express an opinion 
on whether the annual report of royal unibrew a/s for the 
financial year 1 january – 31 december 2020 with the file name 
royal-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, 
in compliance with the commission delegated regulation 
(eu) 2019/815 on the european single electronic format 
(esef regulation) which includes requirements related to 
the preparation of the annual report in xhtml format and 
ixbrl tagging of the consolidated financial statements.
management is responsible for preparing an annual report 
that complies with the esef regulation. this responsibility 
includes:
•  the preparing of the annual report in xhtml format;
royal unibrew     annual report 2020
75
signatures and statements
•  the selection and application of appropriate ixbrl 
tags, including extensions to the esef taxonomy and 
the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for 
financial information required to be tagged using judge-
ment where necessary;
•  ensuring consistency between ixbrl tagged data and 
the consolidated financial statements presented in 
human readable format; and
•  for such internal control as management determines 
necessary to enable the preparation of an annual report 
that is compliant with the esef regulation.
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on 
whether the annual report is prepared, in all material re-
spects, in compliance with the esef regulation based on 
the evidence we have obtained, and to issue a report that 
includes our opinion. the nature, timing and extent of proce-
dures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including 
the assessment of the risks of material departures from the 
requirements set out in the esef regulation, whether due 
to fraud or error. the procedures include:
•  testing whether the annual report is prepared in xhtml 
format;
•  obtaining an understanding of the company’s ixbrl 
tagging process and of internal control over the tagging 
process;
•  evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl tagging of the 
consolidated financial statements;
•  evaluating the appropriateness of the company’s use of 
ixbrl elements selected from the esef taxonomy and 
the creation of extension elements where no suitable 
element in the esef taxonomy has been identified;
•  evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements 
to elements in the esef taxonomy; and
•  reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with the audited 
consolidated financial state-ments.
in our opinion, the annual report of royal unibrew a/s for the 
financial year 1 january – 31 december 2020 with the file name 
royal-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in 
compliance with the esef regulation.

royal unibrew’s balance sheet  2020 amounted to dkk 8,306 million, which is dkk 187 million below the 
2019 figure. the decrease is mainly caused by a net inventories and receivables decrease of dkk 43 million 
due to lower sales activities end of q4 and to amortisation and depreciation of non-current assets exceeding 
investments in the amount of dkk 154 million. further, the performance based earn-out part of the agreed 
purchase price for bev.con aps (cult) will not be paid due to lower than expected performance in 2020, hence 
the fair value of the assets and the earn-out debt have been lowered by dkk 55 million when preparing the 
final purchase price allocation (we refer to note 24).
invested capital decreased by dkk 281 million from 2019 to 2020. roic excluding goodwill calculated on a run-
ning 12 months basis increased by 2.8 percentage points to 32.6% mainly due to the decrease in the invested 
capital. roic including goodwill increased by 1.4 percentage points to 20.2%.
compared to 2019, the equity ratio increased by 3 percentage points in 2020 amounting to 40% end of 2020 
compared to 37% at the end of 2019.
equity at the end of december 2020 amounted to dkk 3,332 million compared to dkk 3,107 million at the 
end of 2019. the dkk 226 million increase comprised the positive comprehensive income of dkk 1,179 million 
(2019: dkk 1,157 million) reduced by distribution to shareholders of dkk 962 million (2019: dkk 971 million) by 
way of dividend and share buy-back.
net interest-bearing debt for 2020 showed a dkk 512 million decrease and amounted to dkk 2,193 million 
at 31 december 2020 compared to dkk 2,705 million at the end of 2019. the decrease in net interest-bearing 
debt was as expected and comprised the positive free cash flow before prepayment of lease facilities of dkk 
1,487 million less distribution to shareholders of dkk 962 million and other items of dkk 13 million. the net 
interest-bearing debt to ebitda ratio (running 12 months basis) was 1.2x (2019: 1.5x). 
funds tied up in working capital showed a negative dkk 875 million at the end of december 2020 compared 
to a negative dkk 671 million at the end of 2019. funds tied up in working capital thus decreased by dkk 204 
million in 2019 (2019: increase of dkk 77 million), mainly due to the beer campaign in finland and channel mix.  
funds tied up in inventories, trade receivables and trade payables decreased by dkk 76 million (2019: increase 
of dkk 55 million), whereas funds tied up in the other elements of working capital such as excise taxes and 
witholding tax on salaries decreased by dkk 128 million (2019: decrease of dkk 23 million).

descriptive notes to consolidated annual report
note 1 basis of preparation of consolidated annual report
basis of preparation
royal unibrew a/s is a limited liability company registered in denmark. 
the financial statements for the period 1 january - 31 december 2020 
presented in the annual report comprise both consolidated financial 
statements of royal unibrew a/s and its subsidiaries (group) and sep-
arate parent company financial statements.
the financial statements of royal unibrew for 2020 have been prepared 
in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs) 
as adopted by the eu and additional danish disclosure requirements 
for financial statements, cf the danish statutory order on adoption of 
ifrs issued pursuant to the danish financial statements act. 
the board of directors and the executive management considered and 
adopted the annual report of royal unibrew a/s for 2020 on 3 march 
2021. the annual report will be submitted for adoption by the sharehold-
ers of royal unibrew a/s at the annual general meeting on 28 april 2021. 
the financial statements are presented in danish kroner (dkk).
accounting policies are unchanged from last year.
significant accounting policies
this section describes the general accounting policies applied by royal 
unibrew. a detailed description of the accounting policies applied and 
critical estimates made with respect to specific reported amounts is 
presented in the relevant notes. the purpose of this is to create full 
transparency of the disclosed amounts by providing a total description of 
the relevant accounting policy, the critical estimates and the numerical 
information for each note.  
the description of accounting policies in the notes constitutes part of 
the overall description of royal unibrew’s accounting policies. 
accounting policies are unchanged from last year except from imple-
mention of: 
•  amendments to references to the conceptual framework in ifrs 
standards
•  covid-19-related rent concessions (amendment to ifrs 16)
•  amendments to ifrs 3 definition of a business 
•  amendments to ias 1 and ias 8 definition of material 
•  amendments to ifrs 9, ias 39 and ifrs 7 interest rate benchmark 
reform – phase 1 (ibor)
none of the new standards have had any impact on recognition and 
measurement on the group's consolidated financial statements 2020.
new and amended standards and interpretations 
that have not yet taken effect
at the time of publication of this annual report, the iasb has issued new 
and amended financial reporting standards and interpretations which 
are potentially relevant, but not mandatory, for royal unibrew a/s at 
the time of preparation of the annual report for 2020:
•  ifrs 17 insurance contracts including amendments to ifrs 17
•  amendments to ias 1: classification of liabilities as current or 
non-current 
•  amendments to ifrs 3 business combinations: reference to the 
conceptual framework 
•  amendments to ias 16 property, plant and equipment: proceeds 
before intended use 
•  amendments to ias 37 provisions, contingent liabilities and contin-
gent asset: onerous contracts – costs of fulfilling a contract 
•  annual improvements 2018 – 2020 
•  amendments to ifrs 4 insurance contracts – deferral of ifrs 9 
•  amendments to ifrs 9, ias 39, ifrs 7, ifrs 4 and ifrs 16: interest 
rate benchmark reform – phase 2
the adopted, not yet effective standards and interpretations will be 
implemented as they become mandatory for royal unibrew a/s. none 
of the new standards or interpretations are expected to have a signif-
icant impact on recognition and measurement for royal unibrew a/s.
consolidated financial statements
the consolidated financial statements comprise royal unibrew a/s 
(the parent company) and enterprises in which the parent company 
exercises control (subsidiaries).
enterprises in which the group holds between 20% and 50% of the 
votes and exercises significant influence but not control are classified 
as associates.
the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis 
of financial statements of all group enterprises prepared under the 
group’s accounting policies by combining accounting items of a uniform 
nature. elimination is made of intercompany income and expenses, 
unrealized intercompany profits and losses, balances and sharehold-
ings. comparative figures are not adjusted for newly acquired, sold or 
wound-up enterprises. 
acquired enterprises are recognised as of the date of acquisition. enter-
prises disposed of are recognised in the consolidated income statement 
up until the date of disposal.
non-controlling interests’s share of profit/loss for the year and of the 
equity in subsidiaries is included as part of royal unibrews profit and 
equity respetively, but shown as seperate items.
translation policies
for each of the reporting entities of the group, a functional currency 
is determined. the functional currency is the currency of the primary

economic environment in which the reporting entity operates. transac-
tions in other currencies than the functional currancy are transactions 
in foreign currencies.
transactions in other currencies than the functional currency are in-
itially translated into danish kroner (dkk) at the exchange rates at 
the dates of transaction. receivables, payables and other monetary 
items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are 
translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. exchange 
adjustments arising due to differences between the transaction date 
rates and the rates at the dates of payment or the rates at the balance 
sheet date, respectively, are recognised in financial income and ex-
penses in the income statement. property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets, inventories and other non-monetary asset purchase 
in foreign currencies and measured at historical cost are translated at 
the transaction date rates.
on recognition in the consolidated financial statements of enterprises 
with another functional currency than  danish kroner (dkk), income 
statements are translated at average annual exchange rates. balance 
sheet items are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet 
date. 
exchange adjustments arising on the translation of the opening balance 
sheet items of foreign enterprises at exchange rates at the balance 
sheet date and on the translation of income statements from average 
exchange rates to exchange rates at the balance sheet date are recog-
nised in other comprehensive income. similarly, exchange adjustments 
arising due to changes made directly in equity of foreign enterprises 
are recognised in other comprehensive income.  
on recognition in the consolidated financial statements of associates 
with a functional currency that differs from the presentation currency 
of the parent company, the share of results for the year is translated 
at average exchange rates, and the share of equity including goodwill 
is translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. exchange 
adjustments arising on the translation of the share of the opening 
equity of foreign associates at exchange rates at the balance sheet 
date and on the translation of the share of results for the year from 
average exchange rates to exchange rates at the balance sheet date 
are recognised in other comprehensive income and classified in equity 
under a separate translation reserve. 
in connection with the preparation of the parent company and consoli-
dated financial statements, management makes estimates and judge-
ments as to how recognition and measurement of revenue, assets and 
liabilities should take place based on the accounting policies applied.
judgements as an element in significant accounting policies 
the calculation of carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities 
requires judgement as to how assets and liabilities should be classified 
in the financial statements and how future events will affect the value 
of these assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. in connection 
with the financial reporting for 2020, the following judgments have been 
considered material affecting the related items as described in relevant 
notes, see list below.
critical accounting estimates
management’s estimates are based on assumptions which manage-
ment considers reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and 
unpredictable. in connection with the financial reporting for 2020, the 
following critical estimates have been made as described in the notes, 
see list below.

the group’s financial risks are managed centrally according to the 
treasury policy approved by the board of directors, which includes 
guidelines for the handling of currency, interest rate, liquidity and credit 
risks. commodity risks are also managed under a commodity risk policy 
approved by the board of directors.
currency risk
royal unibrew is exposed to currency risks through the geographic 
spread of the group’s activities. this currency exposure is reflected 
through the activities in the subsidiaries and the parent company’s 
export activities where cash flows are earned in foreign currencies, 
and in connection with the purchase of raw materials primarily in eur 
and usd, including purchases which involve an indirect usd risk on 
the part of the purchase price related to the raw material element. 
purchases are in all materiality made in the currencies in which the 
group has income, which results in a total reduction of the currency 
risk. furthermore, the translation of loans to/from subsidiaries as well 
as the group’s net debt is subject to currency risk where these are not 
established in dkk.
the above describes royal unibrew’s transaction risks, which are 
hedged actively according to the treasury policy. eur is not hedged as 
the risk is immaterial provided that the existing 0.5% band of dkk to 
eur under denmark’s monetary policy is maintained. the objective is 
to reduce negative effects on the group’s profit and cash flows (cf. note 
4). the risk is therefore monitored and hedged continually. the group’s 
cash flows are primarily in eur, usd, cad and gbp.
the total gross currency risk (before hedging) on the balance sheet 
items was calculated at 31 december 2020. the following table shows

the sensitivity to a positive change in the cross rates at 31 december 
2020 with all other variables remaining unchanged. a negative change 
has a corresponding effect merely with the sign reversed.
royal unibrews translation risk relates primarily to us (usd), canada 
(cad), uk (gbp),  france, italy, finland, latvia, estonia as well as lithu-
ania (eur). the translation risk related to royal unibrew’s investments 
in foreign subsidiaries is, as a general rule, not hedged.
financial risks such as the loss of competitive strength due to long-
term exchange rate changes are not hedged by financial instruments 
but are included in royal unibrew’s strategic considerations and risk 
management.
interest rate risk
royal unibrew’s interest rate risk at consolidation is substantially re-
lated to the group’s loan portfolio which is primarily denominated in 
dkk and eur. interest rate changes will affect the market value of 
fixed-interest loans as well as interest payments on floating-rate lia-
bilities. debt is established only in currencies in which the group has 
commercial activities.
in royal unibrew’s assessment, the key interest rate risk is related to 
the immediate effect of interest rate changes on the group’s interest 
expenses and payment flows and royal unibrew focuses only secondar-
ily on changes in the market value of the debt. it is group policy to limit 
the effect of interest rate changes on profit and cash flows while, within 
this framework, also achieving the lowest possible financing cost. at the 
end of 2020, mortgage debt amounted to dkk 850 million (2019: dkk 855 
million) with an average term to maturity of 9.3 years (2019: 9.8 years). 
bank debt comprises committed bank credit facilities and long term 
loan with an agreed term to maturity between 2 to 5 years (2019: 3 to 6  
years). 52% (2019: 46%) of the mortgage and bank debt is fixed-interest 
through the group’s hedging of interest rate risk and fixed rate loans 
with a fixed-interest period between 4-5 years (2019: 1-6 years). a one 
percentage point interest rate change will affect the group’s interest 
expenses by approx +/- dkk 7 million (2019: approx +/- dkk 11 million), 
and the interest expenses of the parent company by approx  +/- dkk 5 
million (2019: approx +/- dkk 3 million).
credit risks
the group’s credit risks relate primarily to trade receivables and coun-
terparty risks.
the group’s counterparty risks comprise both commercial and financial 
counterparty risk. the commercial counterparty risk relates primarily 
to business agreements with a built-in element of firm rate/price. the 
financial counterparty risk relates to hedging agreements as well as 
net bank deposits. the financial counterparty risk is actively reduced by 
distributing net bank deposits on banks in accordance with the credit 
rating criteria determined in the treasury policy. 
royal unibrew seeks to limit risks relating to credit granting to cus-
tomers in export markets through extensive use of insurance cover and 
other types of hedging of payments. where effective hedges cannot be 
established, royal unibrew has established procedures for approval of 
such risks. the credit risk is generally higher relating to customers in 
the on-trade sales channel than relating to off-trade customers. this 
difference in credit risk is addressed through various approval proce-
dures and credit granting conditions for customers in the two sales

note 3 financial risk management (continued)
channels. in finland, risks on major single receivables from customers 
are reduced through sale of the receivables dkk 481 million (2019: dkk 
347 million). the increase was caused by the beer campaign in finland 
ending q1 2021. credit risks relating to trade receivables are reduced 
by setting off accrued bonus. at 31 december 2020, accrued bonus 
amounts to dkk 188 million (2019: dkk 236 million) set off against 
trade receivables.
the maximum credit risk corresponds to the carrying amount of the 
financial assets.
liquidity risks
it is group policy that its cash resources should be adequate to meet 
the expected liquidity requirements in the current and next financial 
year. the cash resources may be bank deposits, short-term bonds and 
unutilised credit facilities. 
capital management
royal unibrew wants to ensure structural and financial flexibility as well 
as competitive power. to ensure this, continuous assessment is made 
to determine the appropriate capital structure of royal unibrew. it is the 
target that the group’s net interest-bearing debt should not exceed 2.5 
x ebitda and that an equity ratio of at least 30% should be maintained 
at year end. the target for dividend payout ratio is 40-60% of the profit. 
at the operational level, continuous efforts are directed at optimising 
working capital. subject to adequate capacity and capability, invest-
ments in production facilities will be limited to replacement of individual 
components, related to specific products or to optimisation of selected 
processes as well as maintenance.
commodity risks
the commodity risk relates primarily to the purchasing of cans (alu-
minium), malt (barley), hops and packaging materials (cardboard) as 
well as energy. the commodity risk is actively hedged commercially and 
financially in accordance with the group’s treasury policy. 
the objective of managing royal unibrew’s commodity risk is to achieve 
a smooth and time-differentiated effect of commodity price increases, 
which is primarily achieved by entering into fixed-price agreements 
with the relevant suppliers. as regards to the group’s purchase of cans, 
financial contracts have been made to hedge the risk of aluminium 
price increases. exchange rate changes with respect to the settlement 
currency of aluminium (usd) are an element of the overall currency 
risk management.
the most significant part of purchases for the next 12 months has, in 
accordance with royal unibrew’s policy, been hedged by entering into 
supplier agreements and financial contracts. a +/-10% change in the 
price of aluminium would have an effect on the income statement of 
approx +/- dkk 7 million (2019: dkk 4 million).

derivative financial instruments
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair values. positive and negative fair values of derivative financial instruments are included 
as other receivables and other payables, respectively.
changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value 
hedges of a recognised asset or a recognised liability are recognised in the income statement as are any 
changes in the value of the hedged asset or the hedged liability.
changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of 
future cash flows are recognised in other comprehensive income. income and expenses relating to such 
hedging transactions are transferred from other comprehensive income on realisation of the hedged item 
and are recognised in the same entry as the hedged item.
for derivative financial instruments which do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in fair values 
are recognised on a current basis in financial income and expenses in the income statement. 
derivative financial instruments
when entering into derivative financial instruments, management exercises judgement to determine whether 
the instrument qualifies as effective hedging of recognised assets or liabilities or expected future cash flows. 
derivative financial instruments recognised are tested for effectiveness at least quarterly, and any ineffec-
tiveness identified is recognised in the income statement.

currency, commodity and interest rate risks and use of derivative financial instruments
hedging of currency, commodity and interest risk
the risk is managed by entering into derivatives such as forward contracts and swaps.
at the end of 2020, the group had only few short term fx contracts, to cover the balance sheet exposure end 
of 2020 in usd, cad and gbp. 
the group actively hedges the commodity risk related to aluminium. at the end of 2020, the group has hedged 
61% (2019: 71%) of the expected use with in the next 12 month.
the interest rate swaps hedge the  interest rate exposure on the the mortgage debt in denmark and finland.
hedge effectiveness is assessed on a regular basis by comparing changes in the value and timing of the 
underlaying exposure, with the value and timing of the designated hedging transaction.
derivative financial instruments entered into to hedge expected future transactions and qualifying as hedge

segment reporting
the group’s business segment is beverage sales. reporting on the business segment is by geographical mar-
kets. segment reporting is based on the group’s returns and risks and its internal financial reporting system.
items included in net profit for the year, including income from investments in associates and financial income 
and expenses, are allocated to the extent that the items are directly or indirectly attributable to the markets. 
items allocated both by direct and indirect computation comprise “production costs” and “administrative 
expenses”, which are allocated by indirect computation based on allocation keys determined on the basis of 
the market’s drain on key resources. administrative expenses incurred in the group functions of the parent 
company are partly allocated.
assets comprise the non-current assets that are directly or indirectly used in connection with activities in 
the markets.
segment liabilities comprise liabilities derived from activities in the market, including provisions, trade  payables, 
vat, excise duties and other payables.

net revenue
net revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement at the point in time when the control 
of goods and products is transferred to the customer, which is generally upon delivery, and if revenues can 
be measured reliably and are expected to be received.
net revenue from contracts with customers is measured at an amount that reflects the consideration to which 
the group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods. net revenue is measured exclusive of vat and 
net of discounts as well as excise duties collected on behalf of third parties.
the group gives various discounts and fees depending on the nature of the customer and business.
discounts comprise unit price reductions as well as contributions to promotional activities and product pro-
motion based on volumes or value of purchases. the discounts are either granted as deductions from the 
invoice amount or are earned as a bonus paid at the end of the bonus period. all types of discounts granted 
are recognised in net revenue
the group considers whether contracts include other promises that constitute separate performance obli-
gations and to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated.

comment
the share-based payments to the executive management comprise a programme of 17,921 restricted (condi-
tional) shares allotted for no consideration vesting in the period 1 january 2017 to 31 december 2020.
these shares are excerciable at 31 december 2020. no further restricted (conditional) shares are outstanding 
at 31 december 2020.
share-based payments
the group only has schemes classified as equity-settled schemes. restricted shares are measured at fair 
value at the time of granting and are recognised in staff expenses in the income statement over the vesting 
period. the counter item is recognised directly in equity. 
at the initial recognition of the restricted shares, the number of shares expected to vest is estimated. sub-
sequently, the estimate of the number of restricted shares is revised so that the total recognition is based on 
the actual number of shares allotted.
share-based payments
the fair value of the expected allotment of restricted shares is estimated under the black-scholes model. in 
determining fair value, conditions and terms related to the restricted shares are taken into account. 
the market value of program applying to 2020 has been calculated under the  black-scholes model at dkk 
370 per share of dkk 2, which is equal to  royal unibrew a/s market price at the time of allotments 6 march 
2018. the market price was dkk 7 million for the estimated maximum number of shares. the market value 
has been charged to the income statement on an estimated straight-line basis over the vesting period, cor-
responding to the rate at which the conditions for the allotment of the shares was expected to be met. the 
conditions have been fully (100%) met at 31 december 2020.

senting revenue for the year, including expenses for raw materials and consumables purchases, salaries 
and wages, renting and leasing as well as depreciation of and impairment losses on plant and machinery.

leases
 under ifrs 16, the group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the definition of a lease 
based on the assessment of whether:
•  fulfilment of the arrangement was dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets; and
•  the arrangement had conveyed a right to use the asset. an arrangement conveyed the right to use the 
asset if one of the following was met:
•  the purchaser had the ability or right to operate the asset while obtaining or controlling more than an 
insignificant amount of the output;
•  the purchaser had the ability or right to control physical access to the asset while obtaining or controlling 
more than an insignificant amount of the output; or
•  facts and circumstances indicated that it was remote that other parties would take more than an insig-
nificant amount of the output, and the price per unit was neither fixed per unit of output nor equal to the 
current market price per unit of output.”

impairment test of goodwill and trademarks
as in 2019, the impairment test in 2020 did not give rise to recognising any impairment losses. 
the carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives at 31 december 2020 is related 
to the cash-generating operational units and breaks down as follows:

the recoverable amount is based on value in use, which is calculated by means of expected net cash flows 
on the basis of budgets and forecasts for 2021-2023 approved by management as well as estimated market 
driven discount rates and growth rates.
the consumption in the markets in which royal unibrew operate is generally expected to regain the negative 
impact from covid-19 on the 2020 as from h2 2021. in western europe and baltic sea consumption of royal 
unibrews beverage categories is in addition to the assumed disapperance in h2 2021 of covid-19 impact 
expected to be at the same level as in 2020 but changing towards high value products in the coming years. 
through further developing the businesses acquired in 2018 and 2019, continued focus on exploiting commercial 
opportunities and innovation following the consumer trends, royal unibrew expects to gain market shares and 
consequently increase the revenue and earnings from the core brands and business areas. gross margins are 
expected to remain stable at the present level through continuous focus on value management and continuous 
efficiency improvements. the key assumptions for the calculation of recoverable amount are shown below.

dividual markets. the discount rates applied are before tax and reflect current specific risks in the individual

comment
goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives relating to hartwall (finland) represents more than 10% 
of the total value of goodwill and trademarks. 
development costs incurred are immaterial and have been recognised in production costs.
goodwill
goodwill is initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost. subsequently, goodwill is measured at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses.
the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the group’s cash-generating units at the time of acquisition. the 
determination of cash-generating units is based on management structure and internal financial management. 
trademarks, distribution rights and customer relations
trademarks, distribution rights and customer relations are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost. 
subsequently, they are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and less any accumulated impair-
ment losses. distribution rights and customer relations are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful lives. 
trademarks are not amortised as they are all well-established, old and profitable trademarks which custom-
ers are expected to continue demanding unabatedly, other things being equal, and which management is not 
planning to stop selling and marketing.
distribution rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, maximum 20 years. 
customer relations are amortised on a straigt-line basis over their estimated useful lives, maximum 5 years.
goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested annually for impairment. 
it is the group’s strategy to maintain trademarks and their value.

the forecasted results 2019 approved by management are based on previously achieved results and expected 
market developments, see above. the average growth rates applied are in accordance with management’s 
expectations taking into account industry conditions in the individual markets. the discount rates applied are 
before tax and reflect current specific risks in the individual market.  external consultants have advised how 
to determine the discounts rates. in western europe, the highest point of the range indicated for the discount 
rate relates to italy. in baltic sea, the lowest point of the range indicated for the growth rates of terminal 
value and discount rate relates to finland. the assumptions applied by management are inherently subject 
to uncertainty and unpredictability. reasonably probable changes will not lead to recognition of impairment 
losses, why no sensitivity analysis has been disclosed.
impairment 
the carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual 
basis to determine whether impairment has incurred other than that expressed by normal amortisation 
and depreciation. if so, the asset is written down to the higher of net selling price and value in use. goodwill 
and other assets for which a value in use cannot be determined as the asset does not on an individual basis 
generate future cash flows are reviewed for impairment together with the group of assets (cash-generating 
units) to which they are attributable.
the carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives is tested for impairment at least 
on an annual basis, together with the other non-current assets of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill 
has been allocated, and is written down to recoverable amount in the income statement if the carrying amount 
exceeds the recoverable amount.
the carrying amount of financial assets measured at cost or amortised cost is written down for impairment 
if, due to changed expected net payments, the net present value is lower than the carrying amount.
intangible assets
in relation to trademarks, management makes an annual judgement to determine whether the current market 
situation has reduced the value or affected the useful life of the trademarks, including whether past estimates 
of indefinite useful lives may be maintained. 
an annual impairment test is made of the values recognised in the financial statements of goodwill and trade-
marks assessed to have indefinite lives which are therefore not amortised. for a description of the discount 
rates and growth rates applied in connection with the impairment test of goodwill and trademarks as well as 
other assumptions of the impairment test, reference is made to the above note.

the consumptions in markets in which royal unibrew operates is generally expected to remain at the same 
level in 2020 as in 2019. in western europe the danish consumption of royal unibrews beverage categories 
is expected to be stagnant in the coming years. in the baltic sea segment royal unibrew expects unchanged 
finnish consumption for 2021 while the consumption in the baltic countries will still be negatively affected 
by legislative changes and the demographic development. through further developing the business acquired 
in 2018 to 2020 and with continued focus on exploring commercial opportunities and innovation following the 
consumer trends, royal unibrew expects to be able to maintain or increase the revenue and earnings from the 
core brands and business areas mainly through volume increase. gross margins are expected to remain stable

property, plant and equipment
land and buildings, plant and machinery and other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment are measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and less any accumulated impairment losses. borrowing costs relating 
to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment are capitalised.
depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets.
profits and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between 
the sales sum less the expenses necessary to make the sale and the carrying amount at the time of sale. 
profits or losses were immaterial in both 2020 and 2019 and have been recognised in the income statement as 
an adjustment to depreciation in production costs, sales or distribution expenses or administrative expenses, 
respectively. 
property, plant and equipment
the expected useful lives of the assets remain unchanged from 2019 and are as follows: 
 
 
 
 
buildings and installations, 
 
 
 
25-40 years
leasing of property, plant and equipment 
 
 
 
over the term of the lease
plant and machinery,

5-8 years
vehicles 
 
 
 
4-5 years
it hardware and software 
 
 
 
3 years
returnable packaging,  
 
 
 
3-10 years
management reviews its estimate of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment annually. 
leases
under ifrs 16, the group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases - i.e. these 
leases are on-balance sheet.
the group decided to apply the recognition exemptions to short-term and low value leases.

judgement concerning accounting policy: financial disclosures on associates 
financial disclosures are provided on an aggregated basis for all associates as none of royal unibrew’s shares 
of net revenue or balance sheet total constitute more than 5% in proportion to the consolidated financial 
statements; therefore, it is not considered essential to provide disclosures separately for each associate.

investments in associates in the consolidated financial statements
investments in associates are measured in the balance sheet at the proportionate share of the net asset 
value of the enterprises calculated under the accounting policies of the group with deduction or addition 
of the proportionate share of unrealized intercompany profits and losses and with addition of the carrying 
amount of goodwill.
associates with a negative net asset value are measured at dkk 0. if the group has a legal or constructive 
obligation to cover the negative balance of the associate, this obligation is recognised in liabilities.
the proportionate share of the results of associates is recognised in the income statement of the group after 
adjusting for impairment losses on goodwill and eliminating the proportionate share of unrealized intercom-
pany gains and losses.

other investments
other investments classified as fair value trough profit and loss are recognised in non-current assets at fair 
value at the trading date and at estimated fair value calculation on the basis of market data and recognised 
valuation methods as regards unlisted securities. unrealized value adjustments are recognised in other com-
prehensive income except for impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses which are recognised in 
financial income and expenses in the income statement. upon realisation, the accumulated value adjustment 
recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to financial income and expenses in the income 
statement. other investments may be classified as level-3 instruments.
other receivables
other receivables under fixed asset investments held to maturity are initially recognised at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost or an estimated lower value at the balance sheet date.
other investments
in connection with the presentation of the financial statements for 2011, management estimated the fair value 
of its investments (48% of the share capital) in the polish brewery company perla browary lubelskie at dkk 
0 due to governance issues. since 2011, management has maintained its fair value estimate of dkk 0 as these 
issues have not subsequently been resolved. the consolidated financial statements of perla browary lubelskie 
s.a. for 2019 (2020 not yet avalable) have been prepared on the basis of polish accounting law and show a profit 
after tax of pln 24 million (dkk 39 million) and equity of pln 364 million ( dkk 594 million). the fair value 
measurement of the investments in perla browary lubelskie is classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

 inventories
inventories are measured at the lower of cost under the fifo method and net realisable value of individual 
product groups. the net realisable value of inventories is calculated at the amount of future sales revenues 
expected to be generated by inventories at the balance sheet date in the process of normal operations and 
determined allowing for marketability, obsolescence and development in expected sales sum with deduction 
of calculated selling expenses.
the cost of raw materials, consumables, goods for resale and purchased finished goods comprises invoiced 
price plus expenses directly attributable to the acquisition.
the cost of work in progress and finished goods comprises the cost of materials and direct labour with addi-
tion of indirect production costs. indirect production costs comprise the cost of indirect materials and labour 
as well as maintenance and depreciation of and impairment losses on the machinery, factory buildings and 
equipment used in the manufacturing process as well as costs of factory administration and management.

receivable
current receivables, other than trade receivables, all fall due for payment in 2021.
receivables
trade receivables and contract assets are measured at amortized cost less allowance for lifetime expected 
credit losses.
to measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk 
characteristics and the days past due. furthermore, an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses for trade 
receivables is recognized on initial recognition.”
trade receivables and contract assets are written off when all possible options have been exhausted and there 
is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
the cost of allowances for expected credit losses and write-offs for trade receivables and contract assets are 
included in sales and distribution costs.

comment
shares were bought back during the year as an element in the optimisation of the company’s capital structure. 
it is the intention to cancel the bought-back shares to the extent that they are not to be used for share-based 
payment to the executive management.
policy equity / proposed dividend
dividend is recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the annual general meeting. dividend distribution 
for the year proposed by management is disclosed as a separate equity item.
treasury shares
treasury shares acquired by the parent company or subsidiaries are recognised at cost directly in equity under 
retained earnings. where treasury shares are subsequently sold, any consideration is also recognised directly 
in equity. dividend on treasury shares is recognised directly in equity under retained earnings.
share premium account
share premium account comprises amounts in excess of the nominal share capital paid up by shareholders 
in connection with capital increases.
revaluation reserves
revaluation reserves in parent company comprise value adjustment of assets from cost to an estimated 
permanently higher fair value. revaluation reserves are transferred to retained earnings when the revalued 
asset is realized.
translation reserve
the translation reserve in the consolidated financial statements comprises exchange adjustments arising 
on the translation of the financial statements of foreign enterprises from their functional currencies into the 
presentation currency of the group (dkk).
upon full or partly realisation of the net investment in the foreign enterprises, exchange adjustments are 
recognised in the income statement. 
the translation reserve was reset at 1 january 2004 in accordance with ifrs 1. 
hedging reserve
the hedging reserve comprises changes to fair values of derivative financial instruments that are designated 
and qualify as cash flow hedges of future transactions.

comment
the change in the deposit on returnable packaging for the year reflects the net exchange with customers of 
returnable packaging for the year less estimated wastage of returnable packaging in circulation. the devel-
opment in 2020 of the liability is due to packaging shifting from returnable packaging toward not returnable 
packaking, e.g. cans and pet-bottles which is not refilled but reused in production of new cans and pet-bottles.
the payable relating to deposit on returnable packaging is calculated on the basis of the estimated total 
packaging volume less packaging held in inventory. 
deposit, returnable packaging
plastic crates, bottles and kegs in circulation and held in inventory are recognised in property, plant and 
equipment, and the obligation to repay the deposit when the packaging in circulation is taken back on inventory 
is recognised in other payables.

the utilisation of unutilised tax losses in one of the group’s foreign enterprises is not certain. therefore, the 
tax asset corresponding to dkk 1.4 million (2019: dkk 1.8 million) has not been recognised.
deferred tax
deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax 
base of assets and liabilities except for temporary differences arising at the time of acquisition that do not affect 
the profit for the year or the taxable income and temporary differences concerning goodwill. in cases where 
the computation of the tax base may be made according to alternative tax rules, deferred tax is measured on 
the basis of the intended use of the asset or settlement of the liability, respectively.
deferred tax assets are recognised at the value at which they are expected to be realized, either by elimination 
in tax on future earnings or by set-off against deferred tax liabilities.
deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates expected under the legislation at the 
balance sheet date to be effective when the deferred tax crystallises as current tax.
in the balance sheet, set-off is made between deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities within the same 
legal tax entity and jurisdiction.

debts
mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions are recognised initially at fair values. subsequently, the 
financial obligations are measured at amortised cost equal to the capitalised value using the effective interest 
method; the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in financial income and 
expenses in the income statement over the loan period.
other debts, comprising trade payables, payables to subsidiaries and associates, vat, excise duties, etc as 
well as other payables, are measured at amortised cost, substantially corresponding to the nominal debt.
debts
in connection with the acquisition of hartwall in 2013, defined benefit liabilities were acquired relating to a 
pension scheme which has not been offered to new employees for a number of years. at 31 december 2020, the 
net liability amounted to approx dkk 5.3 million (2019: approx dkk 6.3 million). taking into account the amount 
of the liability, that it has been at the same level in recent years and that it is being phased out, management 
does not consider it material to provide the disclosures on the composition of the liability required by ias 19.

business combinations
on acquisition of new enterprises the purchase method is applied, under which the identifiable assets and 
liabilities of newly acquired enterprises are measured at fair value at the time of acquisition. 
upon business combinations, positive differences between cost and fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities 
acquired are recognised as goodwill in intangible assets. at the time of acquisition, goodwill is allocated to the 
cash-generating units that subsequently form the basis of impairment tests. goodwill and fair value adjust-
ments in connection with the acquisition of a foreign enterprise with a functional currency that differs from 
the presentation currency of the group are treated as assets and liabilities belonging to the foreign entity and 
are translated to the functional currency of the foreign entity at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction.
gains or losses on disposal of subsidiaries and associates are calculated as the difference between the sales 
sum and the carrying amount of net assets at the time of sale (including the carrying amount of goodwill) net 
of expected expenses and adjusted for exchange adjustments previously recognised in equity. 
recognition of acquisition of subsidiary
royal unibrew acquired in 2019 three businesses, bev.con aps (cult), bruce ashley group inc. and sia bauskas 
alus by purchasing shares in the companies wherein the businesses were established. the businesses assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities has been recognised under the purchase method in the financial statements 
of royal unibrew. the key assets of the businesses are goodwill, trademarks, customer relations, property, plant 
and equipment, inventories, receivables, deferred tax and payables. especially with regard to the intangible 
assets acquired, there are no efficient markets to be used to determine fair value. management has therefore 
made an estimate in connection with the calculation of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities at 
the date of acquisition and has allocated the purchase price on that basis. the fair value calculation is subject 
to uncertainty and will subsequently be adjusted within a 12 month period from the acquisition date if a need 
to do so is identified. the unallocated part of the purchase price has been recognised as goodwill related to 
synergies and the development potential of the activities acquired.

new and amended standards and interpretations that have taken 
effect
reference is made to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
critical judgements and accounting estimates
in connection with the preparation of the parent company and con-
solidated financial statements, management makes estimates and 
judgements as to how recognition and measurement of assets and 
liabilities should take place based on the accounting policies applied.
judgements as an element in significant accounting policies
the calculation of carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities 
requires judgement as to how assets and liabilities should be classified 
in the financial statements and how future events will affect the value 
of these assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. in connection 
with the financial reporting for 2020, the following judgments have been 
made materially affecting the related items as described in relevant 
notes, see list below.
critical accounting estimates
management’s estimates are based on assumptions which manage-
ment considers reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and 
unpredictable. in connection with the financial reporting for 2019, the 
following critical estimates have been made as desribed in relevant 
notes, see list below.
